Students, Come over now if you wanna play hide-and-seek! Me! I'll play! Me! I'll play!
Hitori Gotou," The girl who wonders, Would it be okay for me to join in? and so misses her chance, ending up all alone."
Teacher Kinder," Hitori-chan, what's wrong?"
Hitori Gotou," The girl who ends up all alone at a picnic, swapping parts of her lunch with the teacher."
Teacher Picnic, Here you go.
Hitori Gotou, I'm home.
Hitori Gotou," The girl who doesn't join any clubs, comes home right after school,"
Hitori Gotou," and finds her smartphone full of nothing but messages from her parents and coupon offers. That's me. Hitori Goto, first-year in middle school."
TV," And here, we'll stir-fry it a bit. There's a lot of vegetables, so you can probably make it quickly if you cut them in advance. You can probably do that in the morning, yeah. Lately I've gotten good at making so many dishes so quickly I thought I didn't need to know any more, but lately I'm learning once again how interesting cooking can be. Personally I like a lot of options with rice. Oh, of course. But you—"
Hitori Gotou," Sometimes I think I should really change the way I am... But I always stammer when I try to speak, and I'm really bad at keeping eye contact... A life as the archetypal introvert just seems to fit me best."
Naoki Gotou, You watching this?
Hitori Gotou, Nah.
Instorms Band Member," Back in school, I was the guy who sat in the back of the classroom pretending to read. No friends."
Interviewer, And now you're part of a band that's extremely popular with young people!
Instorms Band Member, Yeah. A band is a place where even introverts can shine.
Interviewer," I see! Now, here's ""Trigger"" by Instorms!"
Naoki Gotou, What is it?
Hitori Gotou," D-Dad, can I use your guitar?"
Naoki Gotou, Sure!
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thanks!
Naoki Gotou," Aha! At last, Hitori's getting into guitar too!"
Hitori Gotou," Maybe even someone like me can shine if I'm in a band! I've made up my mind. I'm gonna learn to play guitar! Then I'll form a band at school, and... E, A, G... What's with all the English? Then I'll play at the culture festival and have everyone go crazy for me! Crazy... for me?"
Hitori Gotou," I practiced six hours every day, so I could learn how to play in front of people... The result? Middle school ended, and I never played a single note for them! I never performed once... At the culture festival! I never put together... The members for a band! And I never made a single friend... In three whole years! Now, in high school... I gotta form a band or die trying! But despite my vow, it's been a whole month since high school started, and yet my heart remains grounded in the guitar, little better than a shut-in... Lyrics and music by me. From the closet with love. But before I cause neighborhood problems playing my crummy original song late at night, I've gotta upload a cover I did of a popular band. It's been a pretty long time since I started uploading myself playing under the name ""guitarhero"" on my dad's advice, but... Wow, my latest video already has so many comments. I've been racking up the views lately, too, and people are telling me I'm good... Yeah, maybe it's okay if I can't handle real life! There are tons of people cheering for me online! The internet is filled with socially anxious introverts just like me! I put the effort in, okay? I brought CDs to school and set them on my desk. Talk to me! I bought band merch and showed it off. Talk to me!"
Speaker Voice, This next song is a request from Goto-san in Class 2-A.
Hitori Gotou, I put in song requests at lunch... ...for the death metal song I'd been obsessed with lately.
Hitori Gotou," Not the flashbacks! Begone! Begone, filthy memories! I wish I could perform live... That... That could work!"
Hitori Gotou, I look... I look so cool! I'm already a total rocker chick! I look like a real somebody! The people can't look away! Someone's just gotta talk to me now! I'm gonna be all over this year's culture festival!
Students," So you could see the corgi's butt... Do we move rooms next period? Science Room B. Hey, wanna karaoke after this? Great idea! You sure? Wonder what I should sing..."
Hitori Gotou, Huh?
Hitori Gotou," Did I go overboard hyping myself up last night? But I'm putting out such powerful rocker chick vibes... D-Did I end up making myself unapproachable?! No, no, no! I'm having a mental breakdown!"
s Friends," Wow, look at that!"
Hitori Gotou, Thump
s Friends, At what?
Hitori Gotou," I-If they're laughing at me now, it won't just be a mental breakdown, it'll be mental annihilation!"
s Friends," Aw, it's so cute, I've gotta laugh!"
Ikuyo Kita, Guitar?
s Friends," My day's immediately better! Right, Kita-chan? Kita-chan?"
Ikuyo Kita," Sorry, sorry! What was it?"
Hitori Gotou," Look, I know. You can't put the onus on others and expect perfect results. This is a gathering place for people just as lonely as me. I bet that guy's separated from—"
s Daughter, Papa!
s Wife, Sorry we're late!
Salaryman," Hey, no problem. Now, let's grab dinner! What would you like?"
Hitori Gotou," They're the perfect freakin' family! Please forgive my presumptuous empathizing... Ah. I broke 30,000 subscribers. Hey, that's right. The online world is where I belong. Sorta makes me not wanna go back to school..."
Nijika Ijichi," Guitar! That's a guitar, right? Do you play?! Hello?"
Hitori Gotou, I-I haven't talked to anyone in so long... my voice!
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, sorry to ambush you. I'm Nijika Ijichi, second-year at Shimo-Kitazawa High."
Hitori Gotou, Hitori Goto. Shuka High. First-year.
Nijika Ijichi," So tell me, Hitori-chan..."
Hitori Gotou," Right to first names, are we?!"
Nijika Ijichi, How good are you at guitar?
Hitori Gotou," Pretty decent, I guess..."
Nijika Ijichi," Really?! Say, I'm in kind of a fix here... If you can't do it, that's okay, but... It's really okay, but I'm in a real fix..."
Hitori Gotou, There's nothing okay about her!
Nijika Ijichi," Okay, I'll come right out with it! Please, will you play second guitar for my band for today?!"
Hitori Gotou, Band?
Nijika Ijichi," We've got a concert coming up, and our guitarist just split! The song's not too hard! You'll pick it up right away!"
Hitori Gotou, A concert?! Right now?!
Nijika Ijichi, Please! Please!
Hitori Gotou," Um, err..."
Nijika Ijichi, Thanks! Let's head to the club!
Hitori Gotou, I haven't even said anything yet!
Hitori Gotou, I got dragged along.
Nijika Ijichi," Do you come to Shimo-Kita a lot, Hitori-chan?"
Hitori Gotou," Oh, well..."
Hitori Gotou," Right, like I've got the courage to visit a fashion town for trendy people..."
Nijika Ijichi, We're almost to the club.
Hitori Gotou," Nijika-chan's fashionable, too. She's got the real rocker-chick vibe. Meanwhile, I'm in a potato-quality tracksuit with a real bear of a set of bags under my eyes, and a back as arched as a cat... Wait, do I also smell like mold? I spend so much time in the closet... No, I smell like mothballs. Meanwhile, Nijika-chan smells great! She smells just the way a high school girl should!"
Nijika Ijichi," Oh, am I walking too fast?"
Hitori Gotou, N-No...
Nijika Ijichi, The club we're gonna play at is called Starry. My big sister's the manager there.
Hitori Gotou," Playing at a club... That sounds weirdly legit. Wait, what's my heart doing?"
Nijika Ijichi," And so... I've been working there part-time... Hitori-chan, are you actually pretty athletic?"
Hitori Gotou," N-No, but I'm always the last one standing in dodgeball for some reason."
Nijika Ijichi, I... I see.
Hitori Gotou," Me? Playing in a club? No, don't back down now! Remember your daydreams of performing at the culture festival! And your first solo show at Zepp Super Arena!"
Crowd, Hitori! Hitori! Hitori!
Hitori Gotou, I'm the girl who sold out the Budokan...
Nijika Ijichi, What?
Hitori Gotou," Oh, nothing!"
Hitori Gotou," Please, don't let her think she made a mistake choosing me!"
Nijika Ijichi, I might've made a mistake choosing her...
Nijika Ijichi, We're here! This is the place!
Hitori Gotou, Th-The dark lands?
Nijika Ijichi, Good morning!
Hitori Gotou, My first club... It's so dark... So stuffy... I-It's so soothing!
Nijika Ijichi," You okay, Hitori-chan?"
Hitori Gotou, I'm home!
Nijika Ijichi," It is not! That's the band that's playing today. They might be a little older than us? After they're done, we'll rehearse too."
Hitori Gotou," I thought bands would be intimidating, but they're all indoorsy, shy introverts! They're just like me!"
Nijika Ijichi, That there's the PA.
san, Good morning.
Hitori Gotou, Please forgive my arrogance!
Nijika Ijichi, What's wrong now?!
Ryo Yamada, You're finally back.
Nijika Ijichi, Ryo! This is Hitori Goto. Hitori-chan! I met her in the park by miraculous happenstance! She's a guitarist!
Ryo Yamada, Oh?
Hitori Gotou, Scary! Is she glaring at me?
Nijika Ijichi, This is Ryo Yamada. She plays bass.
Hitori Gotou, I-I'm Hitori Goto! I'm so very sorry!
Nijika Ijichi, Hang on! Y-You're okay! Ryo's just not the expressive type. Feel free to call her weird! She likes it!
Ryo Yamada," I don't, actually."
Hitori Gotou, Seemed like she did...
Ryo Yamada," By the way, about the manager... She told you to practice until it was time, but instead you snuck out of the club, so she got so mad she went out shopping."
Nijika Ijichi," N-No way! Let's be in the studio before she comes back! You too, Hitori-chan! C'mon!"
Hitori Gotou, R-Right!
Hitori Gotou, Real life is scary. But I feel like there's some fun stuff coming up!
Nijika Ijichi, Here's today's set list and score.
Hitori Gotou, Wh-Where are the other band members?
Nijika Ijichi, This is everyone! We'll be doing all instrumentals this time.
Hitori Gotou," Right. I can handle this song. Though without any vocals, the playing's gotta be all that much better... But I'm supposedly good at guitar. I can do this. I think I can do this!"
Ryo Yamada, Gorilla?
Hitori Gotou," Maybe they'll be blown away by my playing! I mean, I get pretty good... pretty decent reactions online. I even have 30,000 subscribers!"
Nijika Ijichi," Let's take it right from the top. It's your first time, so we'll run through slow, then we can speed it up as you get used to it. Okay, let's go!"
Hitori Gotou," Yeah, let's do this!"
Nijika Ijichi, You suck!
Hitori Gotou," H-How can I suck? I'm guitarhero! I've got 30,000 subscribers!"
Nijika Ijichi," Ah, I'm kidding! Well, not totally kidding, but... Ah, I'm sorry!"
Guitar Man," Allow me to explain! In a band, it's super important to be in sync with your fellow live performers! But Hitori has social anxiety and can't make eye contact, and she'll be inclined to rush ahead of the others! She might be an awesome solo player, but when in a band, she's sub-water-flea level, the worst there is!"
Hitori Gotou, Hello. I'm Plankton Goto.
Nijika Ijichi, She sounds like an unfunny comedian!
Hitori Gotou," And thus, Hitori Goto turned to dust, and never picked up a guitar again."
Nijika Ijichi," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Come out, please! The show's about to start!"
Hitori Gotou, I c-c-can't do it!
Nijika Ijichi, It's not your fault! We just came together today! It's not like I'm very good either.
Ryo Yamada, I'm very good.
Nijika Ijichi," Just look at me, okay! Stay here in reality!"
Hitori Gotou," It isn't like I could do the intro or anything... I-I could offer up my life to put on a harakiri show! Th-They'll at least remember the name of the band, right? Sorry I sucked!"
Nijika Ijichi, That's a little too rock!
Ryo Yamada," It's okay. If they boo you, I'll give them a bonk with my bass. Bonk."
Hitori Gotou, Does a bass make such a fancy noise?
Nijika Ijichi," I mean, bloodshed is pretty rock."
Ryo Yamada, It's rock.
Hitori Gotou," You can't justify everything with ""rock""!"
Nijika Ijichi," Besides, it'll probably just be my friends who come to watch us play!"
Ryo Yamada," And Nijika is my only friend, so..."
Nijika Ijichi, Normal high school girls don't know good music from bad.
Hitori Gotou, That kind of take could get you in trouble on the internet.
Nijika Ijichi, Okay? So just chill!
Hitori Gotou, I d-dunno...
Ryo Yamada, I know good music from bad.
Nijika Ijichi," Well, you're not normal. Hey, that wasn't a compliment."
Hitori Gotou, Sorry.
Nijika Ijichi, But...
Ryo Yamada, We can't force her.
Nijika Ijichi, You're right. Sorry to push you so hard.
Hitori Gotou," No, actually... I r-really was happy you reached out to me. I've wanted to be in a band for so long... B-But I couldn't get the people together... So I just upload covers to the internet instead."
Ryo Yamada, What do you usually play?
Hitori Gotou," M-Mostly songs by popular bands from the last few years, so I could play them right away once the band got together..."
Nijika Ijichi, That's awesome!
Hitori Gotou, It's not. It's the reason I'm the way I am now. Being in a band with other people was a pipe dream after all.
Nijika Ijichi," Covering all popular songs? She sounds like guitarhero-san! Have you heard of her? She's probably about our age, I think..."
Hitori Gotou, guitarhero... M-Me?!
Nijika Ijichi, I'll send you a link if you haven't! She's super awesome! You should hear her!
Hitori Gotou, Awe... some?
Ryo Yamada," She comes up in my recommendations a lot, so I've seen her too. She really is excellent."
Nijika Ijichi, Right?! Though her naming sense is a bit cringy...
Hitori Gotou, It is?!
Nijika Ijichi, I follow her with notifications on! I'd love to play with her some day!
Hitori Gotou," You just did, actually..."
Nijika Ijichi," Look, what I'm getting at here is that even awesome, popular people are out there playing guitar, lots and lots of them, in places we're not even watching. You should watch her later! I think you'll get what I mean if you watch the videos."
Hitori Gotou, I always figured real-life people didn't care about me at all...
Nijika Ijichi," You can't give up on playing in a band just because it didn't work out today! It's possible it's our problem, anyway..."
Ryo Yamada, Our problem?
Nijika Ijichi, Hitori-chan?
Hitori Gotou," But someone this nice has been watching me all this time, and actually spoke to me... It's the kind of miracle most people never experience! I can't let it go to waste!"
Ryo Yamada, She stood up.
Hitori Gotou, I... I'm...
Nijika Ijichi, D-Do you want to perform after all? Hitori-chan?
Hitori Gotou," I know all that, rationally... But I'm still too scared... There's no way I can play in front of an audience..."
Ryo Yamada," If you're scared, you could play from in here."
Hitori Gotou, I-It's the same environment that I play in all the time!
Nijika Ijichi, Where exactly do you live?
Hitori Gotou," How you feelin' tonight, Shimo-Kita?!"
Ryo Yamada, She's suddenly more outgoing.
Nijika Ijichi," By the way, how do you want us to introduce you? Hitori-chan? Should we use your real name?"
Hitori Gotou, I'd... I'd rather not...
Nijika Ijichi," Any nicknames, then?"
Hitori Gotou," In middle school, they called me Hey and ""You there""..."
Nijika Ijichi, I don't think those are nicknames!
Hitori Gotou, I never knew anyone well enough to get nicknames from them!
Ryo Yamada, Hitori... Hitoribocchi (all alone)... How about Bocchi-chan?
Nijika Ijichi, Another tactless comment!
Hitori Gotou, I'm B-B-Bocchi!
Ryo Yamada, She likes it?
Hitori Gotou, It's just my first ever nickname...
Nijika Ijichi, This is making me teary-eyed.
Hitori Gotou," Oh, you haven't told me your band name yet."
Ryo Yamada, It's Kessoku Band.
Hitori Gotou," Kessoku Band... Isn't that the word for ""zip tie""?"
Ryo Yamada, It's brilliant.
Nijika Ijichi, It's the worst pun! We're totally changing it!
Ryo Yamada, Why? It's cute.
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes.
Nijika Ijichi," Band name aside, it's time to play! Don't worry. The key is to have fun, even if you suck! Your feelings really come out in your playing, see?"
Hitori Gotou, R-Right...
Nijika Ijichi, We can always work on the skill part next time.
Ryo Yamada, Yeah.
Hitori Gotou, Next... time...
Nijika Ijichi," Okay, let's go!"
Ryo Yamada, Right.
Hitori Gotou, They're okay with there being a next time!
Nijika Ijichi," Nice to meet you! We're Kessoku Band! We'll play a bunch of songs you probably know, so please enjoy!"
Seika Ijichi, Who's that?
Hitori Gotou," I hate that I can't play as well as I usually do, but... playing in a band with other people is so much fun! I've never really shone before today... And I still don't! This might actually be a low point for me!"
Nijika Ijichi," Boy, I screwed up!"
Ryo Yamada," Your intro bombed, too."
Hitori Gotou, E-Excuse me! B-B-B...
Nijika Ijichi, What?
Hitori Gotou, B-B-B-B-B...
Nijika Ijichi," Okay, you're freaking me out!"
Hitori Gotou," B-Before our next performance, I'm gonna get brave enough to say hello to my classmates!"
Ryo Yamada, What a dramatic declaration. Such growth...
Nijika Ijichi," Okay, I get it. Sure! Then let's have a Bocchi-chan-welcome-party- slash-concert-post-mortem!"
Hitori Gotou," Actually, I'm pretty exhausted from all this social interaction, so I'm gonna go."
Ryo Yamada, Sorry. I'm sleepy.
Hitori Gotou, P-Pardon me!
Nijika Ijichi," There's no ""ties"" in this band at all!"
Hitori Gotou," I'm gonna get over my social anxiety and bring out my full guitarhero powers! For Nijika-chan, Ryo-san, and Kessoku Band! S-Sorry! Sorry!"
Hitori Gotou, Twenty more minutes... Twenty more minutes... Twenty more minutes... Twenty more minutes... Twenty more minutes...
Hitori Gotou," Yesterday, Nijika-chan said..."
Nijika Ijichi," Hi there! Thanks for everything today! You seriously saved our butts, Bocchi-chan Let's have a talk about our future as a band! Meetup at Starry tomorrow, okay?"
Hitori Gotou," The joy of getting LOINE messages from someone who wasn't a relative got me this far, but... If I walk in there looking like the hick I am, they'll all look at me like I don't belong there... I made it in last time because I was with Nijika-chan, but... I wonder if anyone's there? I wish I had someone to go in with. Five minutes. I'll wait five minutes, then go in. No, ten... Fifteen. I'll totally go in after fifteen."
Nijika Ijichi, What's she doing? Bo—
Ryo Yamada, Wait. I wanna watch a little longer.
Nijika Ijichi, Could you please stop enjoying this?
Nijika Ijichi," Okay! I hereby declare the first Kessoku Band members' meeting... open! Round of applause! Clappy clappy clap clap clap! Now, let's see... Oh, wait. We barely know each other, so I dunno what to talk about!"
Hitori Gotou, She just admitted it!
Ryo Yamada, I brought this for just such an occasion.
Nijika Ijichi, Nice one!
Hitori Gotou, I don't think I like the looks of this...
Nijika Ijichi, There! What'll she roll? What'll she roll?
Ryo Yamada, Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun...
Nijika Ijichi, Talk about School TAS for short!
Ryo Yamada, Proceed.
Hitori Gotou," Um... Wait, don't you both go to the same school..."
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, Shima High!"
Ryo Yamada, We chose it 'cause it's close to home.
Hitori Gotou," Oh, so you live in Shimo-Kitazawa..."
Nijika Ijichi," Huh? Bocchi-chan, don't you go to Shuka High? Shouldn't you live around here too?"
Hitori Gotou," No, I live out-of-prefecture. Two-hour commute each way."
Ryo Yamada, Two hours?!
Nijika Ijichi, Why?
Hitori Gotou, I wanted a high school where nobody knew my past.
Nijika Ijichi," Okay, enough TAS!"
Hitori Gotou," S-Sorry... I spend most of my time at school alone, so I don't have any f-fun stories to contribute..."
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, it's okay! Ryo doesn't have many friends either."
Ryo Yamada," Yeah, just Nijika."
Hitori Gotou, Tha-thump. Ryo-san is just like me...
Nijika Ijichi," On days off, she does urban exploration and visits second-hand clothing shops..."
Hitori Gotou," No, she's not... Ryo-san likes being alone! Someone with social anxiety could never enter a clothing shop on her own! The gap between the lonely and the loner is too deep and vast to ever be traversed! I nearly fell into the trap."
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan, let's enjoy the conversation!"
Nijika Ijichi," Next up, we'll talk about our favorite music! For short..."
Ryo Yamada, TAFM!
Hitori Gotou, T-TAFM...
Nijika Ijichi," I like Japanese punk, like mellow core."
Ryo Yamada," I like techno kayo, and lately I've been checking the Saudi Arabian charts—"
Nijika Ijichi," True stuff only, please!"
Ryo Yamada, That is true.
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan?
Hitori Gotou," Oh, um... I like any songs that don't trigger my seishun complex."
Nijika Ijichi, Seishun complex?
Guitar man," Allow me to explain! Songs that trigger Hitori's seishun complex are glitter-coated upbeat songs that include words like summer, ""blue sea,"" fireworks, ""puppy love,"" and other things irrelevant to her personal school experience!"
Hitori Gotou, Such words plunge me into a deep melancholy.
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, Bocchi-chan?"
Guitar man," By the same token, you love bands that write about the bleakness of their high school years, right?"
Nijika Ijichi, Hey...
Hitori Gotou," Oh, yeah! But sometimes I find out a band I love was super popular in school, and they suddenly feel like strangers to me..."
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, please! Come back to our planet, please!"
Hitori Gotou, Rock resonates as the music of the perpetual underdog. Is it really rock if it's sung by life's winners?
Nijika Ijichi," I'm trying to establish some ties, here!"
Ryo Yamada, Since we're named after zip ties.
Nijika Ijichi," Um... Our first concert was instrumentals only, but I'd like to have vocals next time."
Hitori Gotou," Oh, do you?"
Nijika Ijichi," The guitarist who ran off was gonna be our singer, but... Where'd she even go, anyway?"
Hitori Gotou," The runaway guitarist... Maybe she's socially anxious like me. No, there's no way! If you're really socially anxious, you can't even run away!"
Nijika Ijichi," We've gotta find a new vocalist. I can't sing for squat, myself. Bocchi-chan, can you— Yeah... Figured."
Hitori Gotou, Um... Wh-What about Ryo-san?
Ryo Yamada," If I were to serve as frontman, I'd overwhelm the band and crush it."
Nijika Ijichi, Where do you get that wellspring of confidence?
Hitori Gotou, I'm so jealous. I'd like a little of that confidence for myself...
Nijika Ijichi," I know! Let's find a vocalist and write a song! Ryo can write the music, and if you've got off-limits words, Bocchi-chan, you should write the lyrics!"
Hitori Gotou, Me?!
Nijika Ijichi," Well? Great idea, huh?"
Hitori Gotou, The nine years of lunch breaks I spent in school libraries... Was it all in preparation for this moment?
Ryo Yamada," So, what will you do, Nijika?"
Nijika Ijichi," Go! Next, talk about quotas!"
Ryo Yamada," Just shamelessly dodged that one, eh?"
Hitori Gotou, Um... What are quotas?
Nijika Ijichi," The concert we did yesterday is called a ""booked concert."" It's where the club assigns the band a ticket quota to make sure enough people come. Your quota is ten tickets! Anything sold over the quota gets split between the club and the band... But if they can't bring in enough to meet the quota, the band has to pay the rest out of pocket."
Ryo Yamada," So until you get popular, it's a money pit."
Hitori Gotou, That's very concise!
Nijika Ijichi," A bunch of my friends came to yesterday's concert, so we managed to meet our quota, but..."
Ryo Yamada," After that performance, they likely won't be back."
Nijika Ijichi," You said it! And Ryo's got no friends, so she'll be no help... Bocchi-chan, do you— Oh, sorry! Forget what I said. Just please lose the dead fish stare!"
Hitori Gotou," I've got plenty of imaginary friends, but..."
Guitar man," You rock, Hitori-chan!"
Microphone man, Living national treasure!
Nijika Ijichi," Anyway, since we'll need tens of thousands of yen before our next concert, let's get jobs to cover the quota and equipment!"
Hitori Gotou, Okay. Jobs?!
Nijika Ijichi, That's the loudest I've ever heard you.
Hitori Gotou, No. I don't want to work. Too scary! Society is too scary!
Nijika Ijichi, A piggy bank?
Hitori Gotou," M-My mom was saving up for my wedding... But you can have it. Just... Please, no job..."
Nijika Ijichi, Don't make us the bad guys here!
Ryo Yamada," Thanks, we'll take good care of—"
Nijika Ijichi, We're not taking it! We can't take money that means that much to you!
Hitori Gotou, But...
Hitori Gotou, I don't wanna work! Because... W-Welcome... Sh-Should I warm... up? It'd totally be like that... And then that...
Imaginary Prosecutor," For the crime of creeping out the customers, we seek the death penalty!"
Imaginary Judge," Okay, here comes the ruling... Death!"
Hitori Gotou, And then that!
Nijika Ijichi," ...cchi-chan. Bocchi-chan. Bocchi-chan! You weren't listening, were you?"
Hitori Gotou, S-Sorry! Wh-What were you saying?
Ryo Yamada, You should work here with us.
Hitori Gotou, Here? What?!
Nijika Ijichi, You won't have to be scared if you're with me and Ryo!
Ryo Yamada, It's a homey and harmonious place to work.
Nijika Ijichi," We can serve drinks, and clean, and see all kinds of bands!"
Hitori Gotou, Don't wanna work... Don't wanna work...
Nijika Ijichi, Well? What do you think?
Hitori Gotou," Say no, girl! Say no! You have to say no!"
Hitori Gotou, I'll dwu mwy bwest...
Nijika Ijichi, Really? Thanks so much!
Hitori Gotou," Sorry, girl..."
Nijika Ijichi, The job'll be more fun if we're all together!
Hitori Gotou, It wouldn't be social anxiety if we had the courage to say no.
Nijika Ijichi," I'll manage the band's funds, then."
Hitori Gotou, Um... Wouldn't it be better to have Ryo-san do that?
Nijika Ijichi," What's that supposed to mean?! Listen, Bocchi-chan. Believe it or not, Ryo's a very irresponsible spender. Her family's rich and she gets a huge allowance, but she blows it all on instruments, so she's constantly broke!"
Ryo Yamada, Blush.
Nijika Ijichi," What part of that did you take as a compliment? Anyway, let's work hard so we can play live again soon! Then we'll make our major debut in high school!"
Nijika Ijichi, We start work next week! Come straight here after school!
Ryo Yamada, Bocchi. Bye-bye.
Hitori Gotou, R-Right...
Hitori Gotou," And that first day of work is tomorrow. I've been in here for thirty minutes now. I'm bound to catch a cold, right? I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'll work hard at everything except the job."
Futari Gotou, Mom! Sis is drowning!
Hitori Gotou, Catch a cold! Catch a cold! Catch a cold! Catch a cold! Catch a cold!
Hitori Gotou, Curse this good health of mine... Then I'll just have to fake— Nijika-chan?
Nijika Ijichi," Morning! First day of work, right? I know you're nervous, but we'll be there for you! Let's work hard together!"
Hitori Gotou, No fair being so nice while I'm trying to blow off work...
Hitori Gotou," You've made me realize the foolish error of my ways. For making an honest woman out of me, you have my boundless gratitude."
Nijika Ijichi, What is she talking about?
Hitori Gotou," I'm here. Do it, Bocchi! Do it, Bocchi! Do it, Bocchi! Do it, Bocchi!"
Seika Ijichi, Tickets don't go on sale until five o'clock. We're still getting ready here.
Hitori Gotou, She works here?! She thinks I'm up to no good... I've got to clear this up!
Hitori Gotou, C-C-C-C-C-Calm down...
Seika Ijichi, You're the one who needs to calm down.
Seika Ijichi, So you're the new part-timer? You should've just said so.
Hitori Gotou, S-S-S-S-Sorry!
Seika Ijichi, I'm the manager here. Nice to meet you.
Hitori Gotou, V-Very nice to meet you...
Hitori Gotou," The manager's scary. I can't handle people like her. Nijika-chan, come here quick!"
Seika Ijichi," Hey, you're the guitarist who played in the box. Wasn't it... Mango Kamen?"
Hitori Gotou," A new nickname? I like you, Manager!"
Hitori Gotou, I-I'm Mango Kamen!
Nijika Ijichi," That is not her name! Don't go giving her weird nicknames, Sis!"
Hitori Gotou, Sis?! You're Nijika-chan's sister?
Nijika Ijichi," I told you before. When you first came to Starry, remember? The club we're gonna play at is called Starry. My big sister's the manager there. Actually, our family lives in the apartments above it."
Hitori Gotou, My heart was pounding so loud that I didn't hear her.
Hitori Gotou, R-R-R-Really?
Nijika Ijichi," That means you don't have to be so nervous. Right, Sis?"
Seika Ijichi," Call me ""Manager"" here. And keep our work and private relationships separate."
Nijika Ijichi, Don't scare her like that!
Nijika Ijichi," Okay, let's clear the tables first. When that's done, we'll wipe them all down... Huh? Where's Bocchi-chan?"
Hitori Gotou," Sorry. I needed a breather in a dark, cramped place."
Nijika Ijichi, You need a breather already?!
Nijika Ijichi," Here, Bocchi-chan, come over and learn the drinks. Tonic water comes out of here, and beer comes out of this dispenser. The cocktails are on the shelf behind..."
Hitori Gotou, I-I'll never remember it all! Too fast! I just... mummummmmm... I'll have to infuse the knowledge into me through song!
Nijika Ijichi, Where did that come from?!
Hitori Gotou, Cocktails are in the rightmost shelf!
Nijika Ijichi, You're scaring me!
Hitori Gotou, Tequila! Vodka! Kahlua! Rum!
san, They seem fun.
Nijika Ijichi," I'm glad you're learning the drinks, but why don't you set the guitar down? Hey, are you listening? You're not, are you?! You're seriously scaring me! P-Please! Come back to us! Hitori-chan! Hitori-chan!"
Seika Ijichi," Weird... She seemed kind of crappy at the concert, but..."
san, She's good.
Seika Ijichi," Nijika's trying so hard to stop her, I don't think she realizes it... But I recognize that sound from somewhere."
Seika Ijichi, Get to work!
Nijika Ijichi, Why me?!
Nijika Ijichi," For drink service, just pour the drinks they order and hand them over."
Hitori Gotou, R-Right...
Nijika Ijichi, They can pay 500 yen on top of the ticket price to get a drink ticket.
Hitori Gotou, 500 yen per drink? And why a drink ticket system?
Nijika Ijichi," Stop staring like it's totally alien to you. Clubs like this are actually considered restaurants. I don't know all the details, but apparently it's super hard to get a business license to run just a concert venue."
Hitori Gotou, I... I see!
Nijika Ijichi, So we offer drinks and operate like a restaurant. Are you listening?
Hitori Gotou, W-Working at a restaurant is advanced stuff! I can't believe I cleared that bar so soon! Is this... personal growth?!
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, customers already! We're about to be busy, Bocchi-chan!"
Hitori Gotou," What? Wait... Customer service already?! What do I say?! Thank you for your royal parentage... That's not it! J-Just give me a practice run, please! N-No, wait! Stop it!"
Hitori Gotou, Thanks for coming!
Nijika Ijichi, She closed up!
s Customer," Excuse me! One cola, please!"
Nijika Ijichi," Coming! Bocchi-chan, cola!"
Hitori Gotou, Coming up!
s Customer, I'll have a ginger ale.
Hitori Gotou, Coming up!
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan, show some respect for the customers!"
Hitori Gotou, B-B-But I'm not ready!
Ryo Yamada, We're losing the club's inherent darkness.
Nijika Ijichi, One oolong and one highball!
s Customer, Where's the bathroom?
Nijika Ijichi," Down the hall to your right, door on the left!"
Hitori Gotou, I experienced no personal growth whatsoever.
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan, look!"
s Customer, Here they are!
Alexandism Member," Hey, there! We're Alexandism! Our second album goes on sale today, so we're back to doing concerts, but we hope you all bought it! Thanks! We tried to make every single song better than our first album, and if you haven't bought it yet, we're about to play some of those songs, so if you like them, please buy the album! And there's something I want to tell you guys first. The crowd rocked pretty hard at our last concert! So after it was over, a guy came up and offered up his card. And we were so nervous. ""Is this time for our major debut?"" we thought. But it would look pretty lame to let it show, so after a beat we just said, Hello, welcome. Welcome? Habits can be scary, huh? The words that came out of my mouth were the words I've said a million times at my part time job. According to the guy who gave us his card, he wanted to listen to the band on after us today, Tidaman, but we don't get along with them, and we really wanna outshine them, so we hope you listen to Alexandism too! Now, let me introduce the band! Always eating curry before a concert, with his own way of doing things... on bass, Matsuda! And the normal guy who always has our backs... on drums, Rei! He's got so many effects pedals he barely has room on stage to stand... on guitar, Koichi! And on guitar and vocals, without much to recommend him... me! Tsuyoshi! Let's do this!"
Nijika Ijichi," They're pretty good, y'know? It's a good time to relax. Once the performances start, we'll have time to kill."
Hitori Gotou, Right...
Ryo Yamada, Good work.
Nijika Ijichi, Good work! Don't you have to sell tickets?
Ryo Yamada," Manager stepped in for me. All of today's bands are really popular, so she told me to watch and learn."
Nijika Ijichi, That's my sister for you. She's a tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun... ...dere. You know?
Ryo Yamada, Excessive tsun.
Hitori Gotou," S-S-Sorry... Not only did I fail to help you, I couldn't even make eye contact with the customers."
Ryo Yamada, Want this? Sorry it's not for mangos.
Nijika Ijichi," No, thank you. You're doing fine! It's your first day. You'll get used to it!"
Hitori Gotou, Wh-Why are you so nice to a sub-water-flea like me?
Nijika Ijichi," You know... I really like this club. But here and reception are the only places club staff interact with the customers, so I want to do my best to make other people like it, too."
Hitori Gotou, I'm s-s-sorry. I w-worked so badly at a place that means so much to you...
Nijika Ijichi," No, no. That's not what I meant. I meant I want you to like this club too, Bocchi-chan. I want us to have fun working, and to have fun playing. Together. 'Course, I also hope you'll be able to speak to customers with a smile some day, too... It's starting, Bocchi-chan!"
Hitori Gotou," The whole place is united. The customers and the performers are all enjoying themselves. Meanwhile, at my concert... The customers paid 2,000 yen to see that, didn't they? If I stay the way I am, I'm gonna give them the same listless concert next time too, aren't I? I want to make the effort to change, even if only gradually, and enjoy it with the rest of them."
s Customer, Excuse me! Orange juice.
Hitori Gotou, C-Coming up...
Hitori Gotou, Look the customer in the eye. Interact. Smile! Look her in the eye! Interact!
Hitori Gotou, H-Here you are.
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan! Your eyes! Your eyes!
s Customer, Thanks!
Nijika Ijichi," Wow, that was nerve-wracking! But great job! You kept your head above the counter and talked to her!"
Hitori Gotou, I did my best!
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah! Having you here will make my memories of today's concert even more fun. And you've taken a step forward.
Hitori Gotou, A step...
Hitori Gotou," A step. A step?! It feels like I took a thousand, though!"
Seika Ijichi, Good work today. Take care getting home.
Ryo Yamada, Bye-bye.
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thank you for having me.
Seika Ijichi," Not leaving, Ryo?"
Ryo Yamada, Staying a little while first.
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan!
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes?!
Nijika Ijichi, See you later!
Hitori Gotou," Y-Yes, s-s-s-see you tomorrow!"
Hitori Gotou, It's over! I made it through an entire day somehow! This work thing isn't as hard as I thought it would be! I'll do my best again tomorrow!
Hitori Gotou, Achoo! Eh?
Ryo Yamada," Bocchi worked hard, huh?"
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah. And she managed to say ""see you tomorrow!"""
Ryo Yamada, Yeah.
Nijika Ijichi," I'm glad we formed this band. Oh, right! Let's send a LOINE message to Bocchi-chan. I'll say, ""Let's keep it up tomorrow!"""
Michiyo Gotou," She's got an awful fever. Dear, prepare a cold compress, would you?"
Naoki Gotou, Does she need a trip to the hospital?
Hitori Gotou, N-Now I get the fever...
Nijika Ijichi, Now that we've got Bocchi-chan on board... All that's left... is to find a new vocalist!
s Friends, Who's this one for?
Ikuyo Kita," Me, me! It's me, it's me!"
Hitori Gotou, A melancholy Monday has arrived.
Futari Gotou," Feels good to be over your cold, huh?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yeah...
Futari Gotou, Or are you happy your cold let you miss school a few days?
Hitori Gotou, Not at all.
Futari Gotou, How come? You always say you wanna stay home...
Hitori Gotou," I don't like going to school, but for someone like me, even one day of failing to attend class puts me in risk of being forgotten by my classmates."
Futari Gotou," Guess you're a real pain in your own ass, Sis! Oh, and Mom says it's time to eat!"
Hitori Gotou," Yes, it's true. I could burst from the sheer volume of nuisance I inflict upon myself. But wait a minute. I joined a band, and I'm working part-time at a club! Perhaps I've graduated from my introversion! Yes! I'll take my guitar to school again. Someone's bound to talk to me this time!"
Hitori Gotou, Yep. Putting the onus on others fails once again.
Students," Hey, did you watch the latest Oto-Station? I did did! You can stream BAKWIMPS again! I've been listening to them so much since yesterday, they're still playing in my head! Uh-oh!"
Hitori Gotou, Band talk!
Students," What's up, Gotoh-san? You hardly ever talk to anyone!"
Hitori Gotou," All my preparation assumed others would approach me first, so I don't know how to start a conversation..."
Hitori Gotou, I forgot.
Students, In that short a time?!
Guitar man, It's lunchtime!
Hitori Gotou," This is for the best. If I'd managed to talk to them, right about now..."
Imaginary Students, Barging into our convo like that... Was she listening in the whole time or something?! I didn't know she was such a creep!
Hitori Gotou," That's definitely how it'd be! I'll never rise above my station again. I'll live under the radar forever! Thank you for the meal. Still... A quiet place like this is just perfect for lunch. I'm glad I found a nice spot. It's awkward eating all alone in the classroom. And once I become a popular guitarist, I'll go on Oto-Station and say... What were you like in high school? I didn't have any friends back then. I often ate lunch in a dark corner filled with desks and janitorial supplies. I can awe people with how much I've changed! Y'know how it is..."
s Friends, Karaoke was so much fun the other day!
Hitori Gotou, People!
s Friends, Kita-chan's such a great singer. I heard she played guitar in a band before she quit. Wow! Now that's musical talent!
Hitori Gotou," Band? Come to think of it, Nijika-chan was talking about wanting a new guitar-slash-vocalist... Since my cold kept me from working for a few days, I must find a guitar-slash-vocalist to prove my commitment to Kessoku Band! But the thought of going up to a total stranger..."
s Friends," Kita-chan! Heya! I'm super sorry, but I have a huge favor to ask..."
Hitori Gotou, What kind of girl is she?
Ikuyo Kita, What is it?
s Friends, Would you mind pitching in at our basketball game next week?
Hitori Gotou, She's pretty!
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, sure thing!"
Hitori Gotou, She's super nice!
s Friends, Maybe I'll land a three-pointer!
Hitori Gotou," She's pretty, and athletic, and popular,"
s Friends, Awesome! Thanks!
Hitori Gotou," and she plays the guitar... I'm supposed to issue an invitation to someone like her?! In fact, my identity... My entire identity is crumbling!"
Ikuyo Kita, What was that sound?
Hitori Gotou," I worked up the courage to arrive at her classroom, but my mental fortitude lags behind..."
Ikuyo Kita," You're Gotoh-san from Class 2, right?"
Hitori Gotou, Sh-She knows my n—
Ikuyo Kita, Are you looking for someone in here?
Hitori Gotou," S-Say it, Hitori! My band is looking for a guitar-slash- vocalist. Would you be interested?"""
Hitori Gotou, Ba! Gui! Vo!
Ikuyo Kita, She became a human beatbox! Er... Bam-chika-boom-chika... bam-chika-boom-chika...
Hitori Gotou, I... I'm so sorry!
Ikuyo Kita, W-Wait!
Hitori Gotou," Two more additions to my dark past in one day. Lend me your ears. This is my new song: Double Dark Past, Bocchi Acoustic Version. Melancholy days, multiplying traumas Wanna ditch this negative legacy I carry... The memories bring soft, secret tears to my eyes Mourning my past, so many dark mornings Wishing, someday, to just laugh it all away..."
Hitori Gotou," Begone, memories..."
Ikuyo Kita, That was awesome!
Hitori Gotou, K-Kita-san?! How long have you...
Ikuyo Kita," I got so worried when you ran off like that, but that was incredible! You're amazing at guitar, Gotoh-san! That song you were playing had me totally enraptured!"
Hitori Gotou, She's saying nice things about me! What a nice person!
Ikuyo Kita, Are you in a band?
Hitori Gotou, K-Kind of...
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, can you play other stuff? I wanna hear!"
Hitori Gotou," The extrovert aura... It's so powerful, I can't look straight at her!"
Ikuyo Kita," Oh, and you were trying to talk to someone earlier, right?"
Hitori Gotou, Th-This is my chance to invite her!
Hitori Gotou," W-Well, our band is actually looking for a guitar-slash-vocalist, and I heard you played guitar, so..."
Ikuyo Kita," Oh, so that's why."
Hitori Gotou, H-Huh?
Ikuyo Kita," I'm sorry, Gotoh-san. I can't join your band."
Hitori Gotou," O-Oh, but... I'm kind of a nerd, but the others are cool!"
Ikuyo Kita," Oh, it's not a problem with you or anything."
Hitori Gotou, They're holding a barbecue next weekend! They host a sports meet every six months! They party in limousines after every gig! They do so much cool stuff!
Ikuyo Kita, I don't want a band that parties that hard...
Hitori Gotou, And... And...
Ikuyo Kita," The truth is, I can't actually play guitar at all. I was in another band not long ago. I lied when I joined because I wanted to get close to my senpai. But the whole thing was just beyond me, so I ran away."
Hitori Gotou, Beyond you?
Ikuyo Kita," Yeah. There's more to playing than just this strum-strum stuff, right? I'd figured this wooden stick part was just for decoration! It's way too hard for someone to learn on their own. Major chords? ""Minor""? What is this, baseball?"
Hitori Gotou, Her non-comprehension is on a whole other level!
Ikuyo Kita," Did someone teach you to play, Gotoh-san?"
Hitori Gotou," N-No, I mostly taught myself..."
Ikuyo Kita, What?! Really? That's awesome!
Hitori Gotou, It's not that great...
Ikuyo Kita," I know! Will you teach me to play, Gotoh-san? You can be my teacher! You're so brilliant, I just know you'll get me through it!"
Hitori Gotou," Oh, shucks..."
Ikuyo Kita," I want to learn to play properly, go back to my old band, and apologize! So, when can you teach me? After class, maybe?"
Hitori Gotou, I-I've got a job at a club after class...
Ikuyo Kita," Then after work, maybe?! Is there a studio next door? We can do it there!"
Hitori Gotou, Oh... Oh... V-Very well.
Ikuyo Kita, Really? Thanks!
Hitori Gotou," Why am I so stupid?! Say no, girl!"
Ikuyo Kita, Can we start right away?
Hitori Gotou, C-Certainly...
Hitori Gotou," Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! I've gotta get the girls to act like party people!"
Nijika Ijichi, It's from Bocchi-chan.
Hitori Gotou, I'm sorry! Please come to work today blaring EDM and dancing around with energy drinks on hand!
Nijika Ijichi, What in the world?
Ryo Yamada, Beats me.
Ikuyo Kita, Oh... You work in Shimo-Kitazawa?
Hitori Gotou, Y-You've been?
Ikuyo Kita," My last band was in Shimo-Kita, and its members lived in the area, so..."
Hitori Gotou, R-Really?
Ikuyo Kita, Hang on! You can't walk behind me! I don't know the way!
Hitori Gotou, I'm sorry. I'm still not used to being here... I'm so embarrassed!
Ikuyo Kita, I'm the one embarrassed here!
Hitori Gotou, W-We're almost there. It's a place called Starry. Nijika-chan and Ryo-san will already be there...
Ikuyo Kita, I'm sorry. I can't go.
Hitori Gotou, How come?
Ikuyo Kita," I'm sorry. I can't tell you why, but that's the one place I can't go! And you can never tell those people I was h—"
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan! Your instructions were super weird, but I bought energy drinks like you asked! The runaway guitarist!"
Hitori Gotou, Runaway... guitarist?
Nijika Ijichi," Kita-chan, what are you doing here?"
Ikuyo Kita," W-W-Well, I..."
Ryo Yamada, Eh?
Ikuyo Kita, Forgive my prior discourtesy! I'll do anything to make up for it! I give you permission to rough me up good!
Nijika Ijichi, Shh! You're gonna give people the wrong idea!
Nijika Ijichi," What? So you couldn't play guitar, Kita-chan?"
Ikuyo Kita, Nope.
Nijika Ijichi, And that's why you always ditched practice?
Ikuyo Kita, Yeah...
Hitori Gotou, Poor Kita-san seems so uncomfortable... I-If only I could think of something nice to say.
Ryo Yamada, We were worried when we didn't hear from you.
Hitori Gotou," Ryo-san, so smooth!"
Ikuyo Kita, Senpai!
Ryo Yamada," I assumed you were dead, so I've been lighting incense for you every day."
Nijika Ijichi, That's a pretty wild assumption...
Ikuyo Kita, Um... You aren't angry?
Nijika Ijichi, I sorta blame ourselves for not catching on sooner. Besides... We managed to work it out anyway!
Ikuyo Kita," S-Still, I feel too awful! Please, let me make it up to you!"
Nijika Ijichi, I'm not sure how...
Seika Ijichi, How about you help out today at the club? It's gonna be a busy night.
Ikuyo Kita, Th-That can't be enough...
Nijika Ijichi," No, that'd be a huge help! Please join us!"
Ikuyo Kita, If you'd like...
Hitori Gotou, I'm so glad they worked it out...
Seika Ijichi," So, go over there and get changed."
Ikuyo Kita, Changed?
Hitori Gotou, Why does Manager have that outfit?
Seika Ijichi, She's pretty darn good for a fill-in worker.
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, Kita-chan knows what she's doing!"
Hitori Gotou, Sh-She really does!
Ryo Yamada, She'll give me extra time to slack off.
Seika Ijichi, I'll take it out of your pay.
san," You smell good, Kita-san."
Ikuyo Kita, Thank you so much! Maybe it's the shampoo? It's my favorite!
Hitori Gotou, Sh-She's never said my name before!
Nijika Ijichi," You're pretty outgoing, Kita-chan. Wanna try reception? I'll teach you!"
Ikuyo Kita, Okay!
Hitori Gotou, And the job they've never trusted me with!
Ikuyo Kita," 500 yen for a drink ticket! What band did you come to see today? Take a flyer, if you like!"
Nijika Ijichi," Say, not bad at all!"
Ikuyo Kita, I love interacting with people!
Nijika Ijichi," Ryo always handles reception, but her dead eyes are kind of a problem... And her poker face can be scary."
Ikuyo Kita, Ryo-senpai looks fine just the way she is!
Ryo Yamada, Bocchi. What are you doing down there?
Hitori Gotou," Losing my identity. Now, lend me your ears. This is... The Elegy of the Part-Time Worker Who Lost Her Identity to the Just-Arrived Newbie."""
Hitori Gotou," Thanks for watching, everyone! We haven't known each other long, but I enjoyed the precious time we spent together."
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan! Bocchi-chan! Teach Kita-chan how to do the drinks!
Hitori Gotou, R-Right!
Hitori Gotou, Now's my chance to restore my good name! I can't do it! I get nervous when I'm being watched!
Ikuyo Kita," You okay? I think I get the idea, so you can rest a while."
Hitori Gotou, Please forgive my arrogance...
Ikuyo Kita, I'm just glad you weren't seriously hurt.
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thank yo...
Hitori Gotou, What? Her fingertips...
Ikuyo Kita," Gotoh-san, what made you want to join a band?"
Hitori Gotou, It's an indoor activity where you can be flashy and cool... And I wanna be popular... My motives are excessively impure!
Hitori Gotou, W-World peace... I want to work toward world peace.
Ikuyo Kita, How conscientious!
Ikuyo Kita, Here's your cola!
Hitori Gotou," Um, so the senpai you wanted to get closer to..."
Ikuyo Kita, Yeah. It's Ryo-senpai.
Ryo Yamada, Here ya go.
Ikuyo Kita," Unlike you, I have very impure motives. I saw Senpai playing on the street, and fell head-over-heels for her."
Hitori Gotou," Ryo-san was in another band, too?"
Ikuyo Kita," Her above-it-all attitude, her unisex look... It all makes me squee!"
Hitori Gotou, Squee?
Ikuyo Kita, And she just looks so right holding an instrument!
Hitori Gotou," Oh, I know what you mean! Wh-When I hold mine, it looks more like the instrument's holding me."
Ikuyo Kita, Right? You end up like an appendage to the instrument. I wonder how that happens?
Hitori Gotou, It's like we're best buddies all of a sudden...
Ikuyo Kita, That's one thing about Ryo-senpai that—
s Customer," Um, can I get a cassis orange?"
Ikuyo Kita, Right! Coming right up!
Hitori Gotou," Bye-bye, buddies! I'll know my place next time..."
Ikuyo Kita," After I heard her play, I followed Ryo-san's activities for a while, and she dropped out of her last band pretty suddenly."
Hitori Gotou, H-Huh...
Ikuyo Kita," Then I found out she was recruiting for Kessoku Band, and without thinking, I said I'd do it."
Hitori Gotou, S-Such initiative! Extroversion abounds!
Ikuyo Kita," A band is like your second family, you know?"
Hitori Gotou, Family?
Ikuyo Kita," Yeah, you spend more time with them than with your actual family, and you're all chasing the same dream... It's a mysterious relationship, closer than friends or significant others. I've never done clubs or anything similar, so I've always wanted to be part of that."
Hitori Gotou, I get you. I always wanted it too...
Ikuyo Kita, Yes... I wanted to join Kessoku Band and become Senpai's girl! So much deeper and more intimate than friendship!
Hitori Gotou, Wait. Is Kita-san kind of not-okay?
Ikuyo Kita, But that's all the more reason I can't join the band now. I flaked out once already. I'm too irresponsible. I don't deserve to be in the band.
Seika Ijichi," Okay, good work, all. Feel free to head home."
Hitori Gotou, Thank you for having us...
Ikuyo Kita, Thanks for everything today. Good luck with your band! I'll keep rooting for you! Goodbye!
Hitori Gotou, H-Hey...
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan?!
Ikuyo Kita," Are you all right, Gotoh-san? You're not still worried about me, are you? I'm sorry. Like I said before, I can't join Kessoku Band. I can't play guitar, and I already flaked out once..."
Hitori Gotou," I... I... I... I also ran away before the concert. I hid in a trash can, and... A-A-And also..."
Nijika Ijichi," Let's get you up, Bocchi-chan. One, two... Here we go!"
Hitori Gotou," K-Kita-san, your left hand... Y-You had calluses on your fingertips. I... I th-think..."
Ryo Yamada, You'd have to be practicing the guitar pretty hard for that.
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yeah!
Nijika Ijichi," Kita-chan, we'd love to have you rocking out with us in Kessoku Band!"
Ikuyo Kita, Why would you let me...
Nijika Ijichi," Because if you hadn't flaked out, we'd never have met Bocchi-chan!"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yeah!
Nijika Ijichi," I've always wanted to have a band, so I get how it feels intimidating and aspirational at the same time."
Hitori Gotou, S-So do I! S-Sorry. That came out louder than I expected.
Nijika Ijichi," You'd be happy to have her too, right, Ryo?"
Ryo Yamada, I'll only have to pay one-quarter of the studio and quota fees.
Nijika Ijichi," Be a little less honest, would you?"
Ikuyo Kita, I can be part of Senpai's quota!
Nijika Ijichi," So much for that healthy moving-on thing, I guess..."
Ikuyo Kita, But I still can't play the guitar...
Nijika Ijichi, That's okay! Bocchi-chan will teach you!
Hitori Gotou, Eh?
Ryo Yamada," Yeah, yeah."
Hitori Gotou, Ehh?
Ikuyo Kita, You will?
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes!
Hitori Gotou, I can't exactly turn her down now!
Ikuyo Kita," Thank you. I'll work really hard to play guitar in Kessoku Band! Oh, but you should probably give up that party lifestyle of yours... You're dancing like mad every night, right?"
Nijika Ijichi, Where'd you hear that?!
Hitori Gotou," I'm glad it's all mended. It came out like a mess, but I'm glad I stopped Kita-san from leaving. I worked really hard!"
Hitori Gotou," Well, I gotta head out now..."
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan, don't go! You're today's MVP!"
Ryo Yamada, You're the reason we're back together.
Ikuyo Kita," Thank you, Gotoh-san!"
Hitori Gotou," Gosh, well, it was nothing, really, honestly..."
Nijika Ijichi, It obviously wasn't nothing for you.
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san wears her heart on her sleeve.
Ikuyo Kita," But I practiced for so long, and yet I never really learned how to play guitar. It just made this quiet 'bum-bum' sound."
Hitori Gotou, Y-You're sure it wasn't a bass?
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, I'm not that ignorant! A bass has four strings, right? See? It's got the full six strings!"
Hitori Gotou, S-Some do have six strings...
Ryo Yamada, That's a six-string bass.
Hitori Gotou, K-Kita-san!
Ikuyo Kita," It cost me two years' advance allowance from my dad, not to mention my New Year's money..."
Nijika Ijichi, Kita-chan!
Hitori Gotou," And so, Kessoku Band officially had all their members."
Ikuyo Kita, No more! I hereby quit the guitar!
Hitori Gotou, What? Are we breaking up already?
Ikuyo Kita, Is this one defective too? Did I get another bass?
Hitori Gotou," N-No, that's definitely a guitar..."
Ikuyo Kita, I'm sorry I whine so much. I know you're giving up your time after class and during lunch to teach me...
Hitori Gotou," H-Hey, it's not..."
Ikuyo Kita," With Ryo-senpai lending me this guitar, and everyone helping... I have to do my best."
Hitori Gotou, B-But I really am glad... that Ryo-san b-bought that bass off of you...
Ikuyo Kita, Yeah. But when she gave me the money...
Ryo Yamada," This is the last of my money, so I'll be eating weeds from now on."
Ikuyo Kita," That was a joke, right?"
Hitori Gotou, She might have been serious!
Ikuyo Kita," Oh, come on... This one's so hard to hold. The F chord is too hard!"
Hitori Gotou," That takes me back. I was this way at the start, too."
Ikuyo Kita, Ryo-senpai! Hello...
Ryo Yamada, You guys're here early.
Hitori Gotou, Sh-She really is eating weeds!
Ikuyo Kita, Senpai's so wild!
Ikuyo Kita, I'm just awful.
Hitori Gotou, Oh... But you at least managed to play it to the en—
Ikuyo Kita," About that, though!"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes?
Ikuyo Kita," I just realized, I'm supposed to do vocals too, right? But I can't sing while I'm focusing all my motor control on the guitar."
Hitori Gotou, I... I see...
Ikuyo Kita," I was thinking it might be better for the band if I just sang... But then I wouldn't have anything to do during interludes, and I'd probably start fidgeting on stage... Oh, um... Yeah! So... I guess I'd better work harder!"
Ikuyo Kita, Kit-aura!
Hitori Gotou, My eyes!
Hitori Gotou, N-Nothing.
Hitori Gotou, Her eager self-improvement power is too bright to look directly at!
Ikuyo Kita, But are you sure it's all right for me to sing? I know! You should sing with me!
Hitori Gotou, N-N-Not happening!
Ikuyo Kita, B-But...
Hitori Gotou, N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N...
Ikuyo Kita, I'm sorry. Is it that unpleasant a thought?
Ryo Yamada," Hey, nice one. Is that some new guitar showmanship move?"
Ikuyo Kita, Senpai! Do you like it? Then I'll practice it too!
Nijika Ijichi," You don't need to practice that. Ryo's here, so let's meet up at the club!"
Ikuyo Kita, Right!
Nijika Ijichi," We will now begin the band meeting! Round of applause! Now, here's today's topic! The question: How can we be more band-like?"
Ikuyo Kita, It's so half-assed!
Hitori Gotou, It's so half-assed!
Nijika Ijichi," Now that we've got a full member lineup, I figured the first order of business was to get us acting more band-like!"
Hitori Gotou, I... I see!
Nijika Ijichi," I know practice is crucial, but there's gotta be more to us than that! I think we should talk about all kinds of stuff!"
Hitori Gotou, Is she trying to give Kita-san a break from all her practice?
Nijika Ijichi, One tactic is to nail the superficial stuff first!
Ikuyo Kita," Oh, that totally works! Like if you start imitating a new popular make-up technique and end up looking great!"
Nijika Ijichi, Exactly!
Hitori Gotou, It's like they're speaking a foreign language...
Nijika Ijichi, And with that in mind... I made us band merch!
Hitori Gotou, That's a more superficial starting point than I expected!
Ikuyo Kita, Did you just put a zip tie around your wrist?
Nijika Ijichi," Cute, huh? They come in all colors!"
Ryo Yamada, We'll sell them for 500 yen a piece.
Hitori Gotou, What a ripoff!
Ryo Yamada, 650 if they're signed.
Ikuyo Kita, What a steal! I'll take one!
Hitori Gotou, Won't that just be circulating money within the band?
Nijika Ijichi, Anyone else with ideas for becoming more band-like?
Ikuyo Kita, I can set us up an Isstagram and run it!
Nijika Ijichi, Great idea! I hereby appoint you Minister of Social Media!
Ikuyo Kita, And I'll post every day when the time comes!
Nijika Ijichi, And... What about forming a fan club?
Hitori Gotou, That's awfully hasty!
Ryo Yamada," 10,000 yen annual membership fee."
Hitori Gotou, That's awfully expensive!
Ryo Yamada, Membership perks include meet-and-greets and a once-a-year takoyaki party with the band. The fans bring the ingredients.
Ikuyo Kita, What a steal! I'll join!
Nijika Ijichi," Kita-chan, you're already in the band."
Ikuyo Kita," What about you, Gotoh-san? Any ideas?"
Hitori Gotou, What do I do? I wasn't even thinking!
Hitori Gotou, W-Well...
Hitori Gotou, H-Her eyes are so sparkly! I feel the burden of expectation!
Hitori Gotou, Um... Um...
Hitori Gotou," I-If I don't say something, I... I... Nothing's coming to mind! What do I... What do I..."
Nijika Ijichi," Oh, Bocchi-chan can sit this one out. She has a more important job: writing lyrics for our original song! We settled on it before, remember? Ryo would write the music, and you'd write the lyrics! If you've got off-limits words, Bocchi-chan, you should write the lyrics! write the lyrics! write the lyrics! write the lyrics!"
Ikuyo Kita," Wow! I can't wait to hear your song, Ryo-senpai. Have you written it already?"
Ryo Yamada, No. I'll do it once I get inspiration.
Ikuyo Kita, I just can't wait!
Nijika Ijichi," Go for it, Ryo! And Minister of Lyrics!"
Hitori Gotou, R-Right...
Ikuyo Kita," Gotoh-san, it's so cool that you took on such a tough job!"
Hitori Gotou," C-Cool?! W-Well, I can write lyrics like nobody's business! It's the super-easiest thing ever!"
Ikuyo Kita," You get carried away so easily, Gotoh-san."
Hitori Gotou, I'm gonna write the most band-like lyrics and guarantee us a huge hit!
Ryo Yamada, Band-like?
Hitori Gotou, I couldn't think of anything!
Futari Gotou, Shake! Change paws!
Hitori Gotou," I failed to write a single lyric, but I've perfected my signature..."
Futari Gotou," Change, and pose!"
Hitori Gotou, Isn't it cool? Why can't I get my priorities in order?!
Futari Gotou, Jimmyhen's amazing!
Michiyo Gotou, Futari!
Hitori Gotou, I already spent five hours yesterday editing video to escape reality. Done. I'm so stupid! I'm a paramecium!
Futari Gotou, Whatcha writin'?
Hitori Gotou, No!
Hitori Gotou," Here it is! My lyrics notebook from middle school! A curse? Let's get organized. Kita-san's gonna be singing this song. Cheerful lyrics. A seishun song, maybe?"
Ikuyo Kita, Kit-aura!
Hitori Gotou," I could easily write depressing lyrics, of course..."
Ikuyo Kita, Kit-aura!
Hitori Gotou," Nobody wants that, so I've gotta write something band-like, with real Kit-aura! Put yourself in the mind of cheery person! I'm an extrovert! The woman who surfs in the pool at night! The woman who claims the title Queen of Woot! Woot! Woot! Woot! Woot! Go! Go!"
Hitori Gotou, Let's get some vibes up in here! Tequila shots in the house!
Hitori Gotou," No! That's not a cheery person, it's just a party animal! No more shortcuts. You must become Kita-san."
Hitori Gotou," Come over now if you wanna go to Shibuya! Everyone takes Isstaworthy pics right here! They'll be launching fireworks in ten mins, so let's take pictures together then!"
Michiyo Gotou," I know an exorcist, if you need one..."
Hitori Gotou, It's n-n-n-not like that!
Hitori Gotou," Okay, no seishun songs. Let's try a song of encouragement. I personally find status-quo-affirming lyrics annoyingly irresponsible, but... It's so shallow... Any depressed person hearing this song would just drop deeper into despair!"
Hitori Gotou, F-F-Forgive me!
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san?
Nijika Ijichi, What's the matter now?
Hitori Gotou, I-Isn't this an intervention where you tear into me for failing to write lyrics despite all the bragging I did?
Nijika Ijichi, That's perverse! No way!
Hitori Gotou, Then why did you call us here?
Nijika Ijichi," I didn't think of it until now, but there's one other really band-like thing we can do! Take ProPhos!"
Ikuyo Kita," Promotional photos, she means."
Nijika Ijichi, Since Bocchi-chan isn't in Kessoku Band's current ProPho.
Hitori Gotou, C-Current?
Ryo Yamada, Want to see? We took it for our last concert.
Nijika Ijichi," I mean, since Kita-chan ditched us..."
Ikuyo Kita, I'm sorry!
Hitori Gotou, I've never seen such an awful ProPho.
Nijika Ijichi," So, because it's nice out today and none of us have plans, I figured we'd take a few ProPhos!"
Hitori Gotou, O-Outside?!
Nijika Ijichi," We don't have the money to rent a studio, so..."
Hitori Gotou, Taking public pictures in Shimo-Kita is too much to ask of a nerd like me!
Nijika Ijichi," We could do it in Starry instead if you prefer, but a ProPho is important for conveying a band's direction and the unique qualities of its members."
Ikuyo Kita, So we really need to give it everything we have?
Nijika Ijichi," Precisely! We need something that'll have impact, whether it's in a club ad online, a flyer, or a magazine!"
Ryo Yamada, What she said.
Hitori Gotou, V-Very well. I resign myself to this fate.
Nijika Ijichi, Resign yourself? I declare this ProPho-scouting journey on! Let's la go!
Ikuyo Kita, Yeah!
Hitori Gotou, Yeah...
Nijika Ijichi," Stairs... A fence... With plants... At the park... I think we've covered all the bases for broke band ProPhos... Oh, and an evocative wall!"
Ikuyo Kita, I wish we'd brought our instruments.
Hitori Gotou, G-Good point... Having our instruments might make us look cooler.
Nijika Ijichi," For you guys, maybe. Only guitarists and bassists look cool that way. What about the poor drummer? I'm stuck just holding up my drumsticks!"
Ryo Yamada, But that's cute.
Nijika Ijichi," Then let's swap instruments, just for today!"
Ryo Yamada," Nah, that's lame."
Ikuyo Kita," What about here? Isn't it nice? With all these posters up, it has a real ""Shimo-Kitazawa"" vibe!"
Ryo Yamada, That used to be a CD shop I went to a lot.
Ikuyo Kita, Huh?
Nijika Ijichi," Lots of record shops and club venues closing these days, yeah."
Ryo Yamada," Shops that have been there for decades, disappearing one by one..."
Ikuyo Kita, I-I'm really sorry...
Nijika Ijichi," Ryo, you were just celebrating that new book store."
Ryo Yamada, Yeah. I love B&C.
Nijika Ijichi," Kita-chan, don't let Ryo jerk you around. Ninety percent of the things she says are more or less just for vibes."
Ikuyo Kita, But Senpai can jerk me around any time she wants!
Nijika Ijichi," Um? Oh, it's just Bocchi-chan."
Hitori Gotou, U-Um... I-I thought I saw a n-nice-looking wall over there...
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, great work!"
Nijika Ijichi," Taking it now! We're definitely capturing everyone's personalities, but it's not really band-like. Isn't there a way to really make it scream ""band""?"
Ryo Yamada," As I am the quintessential musician, you need only mimic my expression."
Nijika Ijichi, I'd love to know where you get all that confidence...
Ikuyo Kita," But we can't go wrong doing what Senpai says! Right, Gotoh-san?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes...
Nijika Ijichi," A pair of yes-men, huh? Fine, we'll do it. Looks like we're at a funeral."
Hitori Gotou, Yeah...
Nijika Ijichi, But Kita-chan looks cute in any pic we take!
Ikuyo Kita," Aw, no I don't!"
Nijika Ijichi, Sure you do! It's almost like you know what you're doing.
Ikuyo Kita," Oh, I guess it's because I upload pics to Issta all the time! See?"
Nijika Ijichi, That's our Minister of Social Media!
Ikuyo Kita," Bocchi-chan's dying! What's wrong, Gotoh-san? Stay with us! Oh, no! She's flopping around like a fish!"
Hitori Gotou, I've never taken pictures with friends before.
Ikuyo Kita," What do I do? Please, wake up!"
Hitori Gotou, Since... I never had friends before. The only pictures I've taken that weren't with family were class pictures. With those as my only proof of existence for the past fifteen years...
Nijika Ijichi, Look at Bocchi-chan's weird face!
Hitori Gotou," I wonder if there are any other high school girls like me still around? Perhaps I've become a rare species, on par with the tsuchinoko?"
Hitori Gotou, I am... I am the tsuchinoko of Shimo-Kitazawa.
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san's saying the strangest things!
Nijika Ijichi," Nah, this is normal for her."
Hitori Gotou, Noko-noko. Noko-noko.
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan, why don't you start your own Isstagram? What do you think, Minister?"
Ikuyo Kita," Totally! Let's become friends! If we're going to be a band, we should really have individual member accounts! Gotoh-san?!"
Hitori Gotou, If I were to get an account... Someone with self-esteem so bad she's already trying to form a band to get popular despite total social ineptitude... If s-someone like me were to start an account like that... You would witness the birth of... The attention-whore monster! Like my posts! Like my posts! My video site is all I need.
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san!
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan!
Ikuyo Kita, We won't push you to get on social media anymore! Please come back to us!
Nijika Ijichi, You okay?
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes...
Nijika Ijichi," Okay, back to the ProPhos!"
Nijika Ijichi, Nothing's really hitting the spot...
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, what about a jump pic?"
Hitori Gotou, Jump pic?
Ikuyo Kita," It's really photogenic, and it could bring out everyone's personality!"
Nijika Ijichi," Great idea! You're a genius, Kita-chan!"
Ryo Yamada," A wise man once said, any anime where they jump in the OP is a god-tier anime. Would jumping in our ProPho thus make us a god-tier band?"
Hitori Gotou, Where is she getting that from?
Nijika Ijichi," I'm not sure I followed your logic there... But let's give it a try! Five, four, three,"
Hitori Gotou, I c-can't even remember the last time I jumped!
Nijika Ijichi," two, one!"
Ryo Yamada," Oh, I see Bocchi's undies."
Nijika Ijichi," Wow, that's one hell of a picture!"
Hitori Gotou, I'm sorry for putting something so worthless in the picture. Please delete it.
Nijika Ijichi, I was hoping for a cuter reaction there...
Hitori Gotou," If I can't even jump properly, I'm..."
Nijika Ijichi," Okay, let's try one more!"
Nijika Ijichi, Awesome! It's got the band feel and the seishun thing going!
Ikuyo Kita, Do you think I could get a copy of that picture?
Hitori Gotou, M-Me too!
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, we're feeling band-like now! I feel like we're one step closer to becoming a popular band!"
Hitori Gotou, R-Right!
Ikuyo Kita, Kessoku Band is getting started for real!
Nijika Ijichi," Okay! We'll have our concert in summer (TBD), our demo CD sale (TBD), our first album release in winter (TBD), and become Shimo-Kitazawa's own good vibes-iest vibes-band!"
Ikuyo Kita, Sounds like there's a lot still to be decided!
Nijika Ijichi, Good point! We don't even have a song yet!
Hitori Gotou, I t-totally forgot about the lyrics!
Nijika Ijichi," Of course, we've got Ryo and Bocchi-chan on the case, so... Hey, where's Ryo?"
Ryo Yamada, She must have disappeared.
Nijika Ijichi," What a total free spirit! Anyway, thanks for coming today! Dismissed!"
Hitori Gotou," The more time that passes, the higher the lyrics bar seems to rise. I-If I show them this and they're mean to me... O-Or worse, if they're obviously humoring me, I... M-Maybe I should show it to someone and see how they react. Ryo-san, maybe. I don't think Ryo-san would ever humor me."
Ryo Yamada, a
Hitori Gotou," It's a pleasure to make contact with you This is Bocchi speaking \hIf you happen to still be in Shimo-Kita, \hdo you think you might be able to \h\hconsider having a look at my lyrics?"
Hitori Gotou, She already read it!
Ryo Yamada," I'm here, come by"
Hitori Gotou, Huh? A t-trendy café!
Hitori Gotou," I've never been to a real restaurant by myself. I can't even enter a convenience store without psyching myself up in advance. A-Am I allowed to just walk in? How do people just walk into places? How do they do it on TV and stuff? Oh, I know!"
Hitori Gotou," Are ya winning, diners?"
Ryo Yamada," Oh, Bocchi. Over here."
Hitori Gotou," Th-This is awkward. Come to think of it, I've never been alone with Ryo-san before. I don't even know much about her. F-For that matter, why hasn't she talked to me yet?"
Ryo Yamada, That was delicious.
Hitori Gotou," She finished eating! What do I do? Should I initiate? But... That photo shoot sure was fun, huh?!"
Ryo Yamada, Not really.
Hitori Gotou, That could be the result!
Ryo Yamada, Just show me the lyrics.
Hitori Gotou," Oh, right. Thank you."
Ryo Yamada," No problem. Let's see. Oh, ohh!"
Hitori Gotou, She's unusually flustered!
Ryo Yamada, This is good.
Hitori Gotou," I'm not sure I agree, but for the band's sake... Yes, it's a masterpiece."
Ryo Yamada, Though personally I think one is a bit childish for a band.
Hitori Gotou, That's not the right page!
Ryo Yamada," Are you personally satisfied with these lyrics, Bocchi?"
Hitori Gotou," Oh, w-well... I figured we should do something really ""hit band""-like..."
Ryo Yamada," Did I ever tell you? I was in another band a long time ago. Their lyrics were awkward, but I liked how honest they were. But, desperate for sales, they started going in a more commercial direction. I hated that. That's why I quit. We had a little fight about it at the time. And just as I was feeling sick of the whole band thing..."
Nijika Ijichi," Hey. If you've got time, will you play bass for me?"
Ryo Yamada, Why?
Nijika Ijichi, Because I love the way you play!
Ryo Yamada," When Nijika said that to me, I decided to give playing in a band another try. Abandoning your uniqueness is equivalent to dying."
Hitori Gotou, Ryo-san?
Ryo Yamada, So don't write generic lyrics based on other concerns. Write what you want to write.
Hitori Gotou," B-But if I do that, I'll write bitter, social-outcast lyrics—"
Ryo Yamada, But won't it be hilarious if a normie sings that?
Ikuyo Kita, I spend my days cursing you losers!
Ryo Yamada, Bringing a wide variety of individuals together into one sound... That's the color that Kessoku Band will have.
Hitori Gotou, Ryo-san is actually a considerate person.
Ryo Yamada, Let's get out of here.
Hitori Gotou," R-Right! Oh, Ryo-san... The check..."
Ryo Yamada," Sorry, I'm broke. Treat me?"
Hitori Gotou, Wh-What? B-But you're the one who invited me...
Ryo Yamada, I just couldn't take another day of eating weeds.
Hitori Gotou, You're still doing that?!
Ryo Yamada," And this shop just opened, and I wanted to eat here so bad... Please, treat me?"
Hitori Gotou, I t-take back what I said!
Ryo Yamada, I really am sorry. I'll pay you back next month.
Hitori Gotou, N-No need to rush... U-Um... I-I'm going to try my best!
Ryo Yamada, Sure. Can't wait to see it.
Hitori Gotou, U-Um... I f-finished the lyrics... H-Here.
Ikuyo Kita," Gotoh-san, are you all right? You look tired."
Hitori Gotou," I'm fine. I've just been so focused on the lyrics, I c-completely forgot to sleep..."
Nijika Ijichi, Wow! Let's have a look! I can't wait to see the fruits of your labors!
Hitori Gotou, It m-might be... too much of a downer.
Ryo Yamada, It certainly is a downer.
Ikuyo Kita, Ryo-senpai!
Ryo Yamada," But it's very Bocchi. It might not connect with too many people, but those it does, it'll hit deeply."
Ikuyo Kita, Where'd this friendship come from?!
Nijika Ijichi," But these lyrics really are super great, Bocchi-chan!"
Ikuyo Kita, I love this phrase here!
Ryo Yamada, Same.
Hitori Gotou, I m-managed to figure out the lyrics. I'm going to do my best... I hope the band can stay together forever... and I can get lots of pictures with everyone.
Ikuyo Kita, And whipped cream up to the ceiling!
Seika Ijichi," Excuse me, girls. It's your long-awaited payday."
Nijika Ijichi, Yay!
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yay.
Nijika Ijichi, Thanks!
Ryo Yamada, Thank you very much.
Ikuyo Kita, Thank you!
Seika Ijichi," Sure. And for you, Bocchi-chan."
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thank you!
Hitori Gotou," T-Ten thousand yen! 10,000 Yen The culmination of my blood, sweat, and tears! What'll I spend it on? New sheet music? A big manga haul? Maybe I'll buy a cake and surprise my family!"
Nijika Ijichi," Sorry to rain on various parades, but I've gotta collect these for the concert!"
Hitori Gotou," Lend me your ears. My new song, ""A Farewell to Yukichi."""
Nijika Ijichi," I'm so sorry! I hate it too, okay?"
Hitori Gotou," That's right. I was doing this job thing to pay our concert quota. Of course, if I work hard here every month, Kessoku Band will get to play a lot, which is just about—"
Nijika Ijichi," I'm sorry to you too, Kita-chan!"
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, it's fine! Wow! Does it really cost that much to make an album?"
Hitori Gotou, Huh?
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, I'd like to have them to sell at our concerts, and shooting a music video and stuff will cost a ton, too..."
Ikuyo Kita, We'll just have to get second jobs during summer vacation!
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah. Maybe we could work at a beach house or something!
Ikuyo Kita, I'd love to work at the beach!
Hitori Gotou, B-Beach?!
Ikuyo Kita, Or maybe an amusement park!
Hitori Gotou, It's a no-go.
Nijika Ijichi, That would be so fun!
Hitori Gotou," They won't lend to minors. But perhaps, deeper in the internet's shadier corners... I'll have to sell my liver."
Ryo Yamada, Bocchi.
Hitori Gotou," I'm s-sure I could get a loan using my guitar as collateral, s-so please don't make me get another job! P-Please don't make me work at the beach or an amusement park!"
Ryo Yamada," Actually, I wrote the song."
Nijika Ijichi," Is it just me, or is it really good?"
Ikuyo Kita," Yeah, it's great!"
Ryo Yamada," When I read Bocchi's lyrics, it just came to me."
Nijika Ijichi, That's awesome! All the hard work paid off!
Ryo Yamada," That's my girl. There, there."
Ikuyo Kita," S-Senpai! I'm working hard, too! Watch me! I've gotten so good at guitar!"
Ryo Yamada, Amazing.
Ikuyo Kita," Amazing?! Please give me chin rubs, too!"
Ryo Yamada," There, there."
Nijika Ijichi, My dream might just come true. Okay! I'll ask Sis to let us hold our concert here next month!
Ikuyo Kita, You hadn't asked her yet?
Nijika Ijichi," No worries! She let us in right away last time! Right, Sis?"
Seika Ijichi, I'm not putting you on.
Nijika Ijichi, Huh?
Ryo Yamada, Huh?
Hitori Gotou, Huh?
Ikuyo Kita, Huh?
Nijika Ijichi, But why? We just finished our original song.
Seika Ijichi, Why should I care about that?
Hitori Gotou, Th-This feels super awkward...
Nijika Ijichi, We can even pay our quota if we don't bring in customers!
Seika Ijichi, It's not about the money. It's about your skill.
Nijika Ijichi, But you let us play last time.
Seika Ijichi, I made an exception so you could make a memory.
Nijika Ijichi, Make a memory?
Seika Ijichi," Normally, I'd make you play first to apply. You know that, right?"
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, but..."
Seika Ijichi," Sorry, but I can't have a repeat of that awful May performance."
Nijika Ijichi, Can't have a repeat... You mean we...
Seika Ijichi, Just stick with it as a hobby or something. You got more to say?
Nijika Ijichi, You can't even sleep without stuffed animals to cuddle!
Ikuyo Kita, Ijichi-senpai!
Seika Ijichi, That was a weird parting shot.
Ryo Yamada, Would the stuffed animals in question be this beat-up panda and rabbit?
san, That's cute.
Seika Ijichi, Delete that image! Immediately!
Ikuyo Kita," What are you doing? We have to go after her! Don't act like it's too much trouble! You too, Gotoh-san! Let's go!"
Hitori Gotou, R-Right!
Seika Ijichi," Wait, Bocchi-chan."
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes?
Hitori Gotou," What, what, what? What, what, what?!"
Ryo Yamada, It's so obvious when you're sulking.
Nijika Ijichi, Shut up.
Ikuyo Kita," Senpai, are you all right?"
Nijika Ijichi," Sorry to rush out like that. She didn't have to be such a jerk about it, you know?"
Hitori Gotou, E-Excuse me!
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan?
Hitori Gotou, E-Excuse me... M-Manager... said... She said...
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan, breathe first!"
Nijika Ijichi," Here, Bocchi-chan!"
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thank you.
Nijika Ijichi, Feel better?
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes. Um... The manager told me...
Seika Ijichi," Tell Nijika. If she wants to perform, she needs to audition. I'll watch the performances next Saturday and decide... What? What are you doing?"
Hitori Gotou, I-I'm desperately attempting to show obedience!
Seika Ijichi, You should probably go after them before you lose them.
Hitori Gotou, W-Woof!
Ryo Yamada," When a dog rolls over to show its belly, some believe that's not a show of submission, but a show of aggression."
Ikuyo Kita, Ryo-senpai knows so much! But wait a minute... Does that mean...
Nijika Ijichi, An audition?!
Ikuyo Kita," Yeah! And if we pass, she'll let us perform?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes.
Nijika Ijichi," Well, why didn't she just say so to begin with? That sister of mine is so mean!"
Ikuyo Kita, But that means we just have to work hard! Isn't that nice?
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, that's right."
Ryo Yamada," You've got that ""those two are the biggest problem"" look on your face."
Nijika Ijichi, Erk!
Ryo Yamada," We'll record your parts in advance, so just practice miming along!"
Ikuyo Kita, Right!
Hitori Gotou, Right!
Nijika Ijichi, No! No air guitars!
Ryo Yamada, We've only got a week. Don't push them so hard.
Nijika Ijichi," Even if they suck, the passion will come through if they try!"
Ikuyo Kita, We suck?
Hitori Gotou, We suck?
Nijika Ijichi," Oh, sorry! You're really both way better than you were. Right, Ryo? C'mon, back me up here! B-Bocchi-chan? Please don't turn into a pipe shut-in!"
Hitori Gotou, S-Sorry for my momentary arrogance over my success in writing lyrics.
Nijika Ijichi," Ah, it's The Sound of Bocchi!"
Hitori Gotou," Those with uncontrollable arrogance deserve a life inside a dark, dank pipe."
Ikuyo Kita," Huh? They think she isn't good? Gotoh-san? At least when I heard her at school before, even I could tell as a novice that she's really good. Was that just dumb luck before?"
Nijika Ijichi," C'mon, come out now! Please just come out!"
Hitori Gotou," If I could remove myself from your memory, I would..."
Nijika Ijichi," So long as the rhythm section's strong, it'll probably work out."
Hitori Gotou, Y-You think?
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah! I don't think they need to see us all playing on Ryo's level.
Hitori Gotou, Th-Then what do they need to see?
Nijika Ijichi, Hmm... enthusiasm? Growth as a band?
Hitori Gotou, Growth?
Ikuyo Kita," Gotoh-san, thank you. For practicing with me."
Hitori Gotou, I-It's nothing...
Ikuyo Kita, But shouldn't we practice in a classroom instead of this dreary place?
Hitori Gotou," Oh, w-well, actually..."
Hitori Gotou," How am I supposed to practice with all those judging eyes asking, What's a cool girl like Kita doing with that loser?!"""
Ikuyo Kita," Oh, I get it! You don't want to bother people by playing in a classroom! You're so considerate, Gotoh-san!"
Hitori Gotou, She always assumes my motivations are pure! What a nice person!
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, Gotoh-san... I've been thinking about it. I think we just need to show that we've grown as a band— in other words, how hard we've been working."
Hitori Gotou, R-Right.
Ikuyo Kita," When the time comes, I want to be able to say I gave it my all, and that I don't have any regrets. So please stick with me until the day of the audition!"
Hitori Gotou, P-Please don't bow! I-I'm the one who's h-happy to be here!
Nijika Ijichi, What's with the hair? What are we doing?
Hitori Gotou," V-Visually showing our growth as a band""... Apparently."
Nijika Ijichi, More of Ryo's mischief?
Ryo Yamada," Drinking, smoking, dalliances with women, and the mop-top hairstyle... It all equals ""band."""
Nijika Ijichi, You're laying it on a little thick! And no smoking or drinking until you're twenty!
Ikuyo Kita," Everyone say, ""mop-top""!"
Ryo Yamada, Nijika.
Nijika Ijichi, Gotten it out of your system?
Ryo Yamada," We've got an opening for uneven bangs that hide one eye and a perpetually annoyed expression."""
Nijika Ijichi," I'll pass, thanks."
Hitori Gotou, U-Um... I c-can't have dalliances with women. I d-don't think any women would want to dally with me...
Ryo Yamada," Don't worry. Stand in front of VillePan in Shimo-Kitazawa, wearing your guitar and looking listless, and someone'll come up to you sooner or later."
Nijika Ijichi, Cut it out! Stop misinforming her with your subjective experience! Let's do it right!
Ryo Yamada, But growth isn't always visible. And the criteria is quite vague.
Nijika Ijichi," No, it's very clear! We just need to convince Sis to take us on! Practice is the only way! Now, get changed! You too, Kita-chan!"
Ikuyo Kita, R-Right!
Hitori Gotou," I think I get what Ryo-san's saying, though. It's hard to know exactly what ""growth"" means. I don't think it's quite the same as effort put in. My life as of late has been a whirlwind. I started working. I've gained the ability to occasionally look others in the eye. But I don't think that's the same thing as growing as a band. I've just evolved past the water flea or euglena stage and now stand at the starting line of basic humanity. I thought finally starting the band I dreamed about would be growth in itself, but... I..."
Ikuyo Kita, Ow!
Ryo Yamada, Your finger's looking better.
Nijika Ijichi," Okay, let's call it a day."
Ikuyo Kita, Already?
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah. Get a good night's rest for the audition tomorrow.
Ryo Yamada, See you.
Ikuyo Kita," Great work, all!"
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan! Sorry, sorry! Didn't mean to startle you."
Hitori Gotou, I-It's okay.
Nijika Ijichi," Cola, right?"
Hitori Gotou, Wh-Wh-What? Yes?
Nijika Ijichi, Here!
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thank you.
Nijika Ijichi," Sorry if I forced you to go along with this. I mean, you kind of just got roped into joining Kessoku Band from the start, right? I remember you saying... you'd been wanting to be part of a band, but I never actually asked you what kind of band you wanted to be in, or what your reasons were for playing in this band now."
Hitori Gotou," Oh, well..."
Hitori Gotou, Should I tell her I started because I wanted people going crazy for me?
Nijika Ijichi," Everyone's got their own reasons, right? It's not like performing live is the only way to go now. You can always post videos and stuff nowadays if what you want is to get your sound out there."
Hitori Gotou," It's true. I like uploading as guitarhero too, and I have to admit that the online world suits me well..."
Nijika Ijichi," See... I've got this kind of goal. A dream, really. So I can get a little fired up without realizing it. So... I worry I might have dragged you into this against your will."
Hitori Gotou, N-N-Not at all! It's n-n-not against my will at all!
Nijika Ijichi, Really? That's good.
Hitori Gotou," The reason you wanted a band... It's to get famous and perform at the Budokan, right?"
Nijika Ijichi," My real dream is actually a little past that. But I can't tell you just yet! Anyway, see you tomorrow!"
Nijika Ijichi," We're Kessoku Band. We're going to play our song, Guitar, Solitude, and the Blue Planet!"
Hitori Gotou," I spent all night thinking about my reason for playing in this band now. I do still want to become popular and have everyone go crazy for me... But now... it's not just for me. It's the four of us! I never figured out what it means to have ""growth."" But right now, what I want is to stay with this band and have people go crazy for us! I want to make Nijika-chan's actual dream come true."
Nijika Ijichi, Thank you for having us!
Ikuyo Kita, Thank you for having us!
Ryo Yamada, Thank you for having us!
Hitori Gotou, Thank you for having us!
Seika Ijichi," Pretty good. Or so I'd like to say, but... Drums, you're too tense. Guitars, you're both looking down too much. Bass, you're too holed up in your own little world. Still... I think I know what kind of band you are now."
Nijika Ijichi, Thank you... for the feedback.
Seika Ijichi, Huh? What's with that reaction?
Nijika Ijichi, W-Well... I mean...
Seika Ijichi," I'm saying, I learned what kind of band you are! This is the part where you cheer."
san, I think she's saying you passed.
Seika Ijichi, That's what I said! You passed!
Nijika Ijichi," Sis, you're so misleading!"
Hitori Gotou, Y-You mean... we did it?
Ikuyo Kita, We did it! She says we passed!
Hitori Gotou, Yes!
Ikuyo Kita, We really did it?
Hitori Gotou, Yes!
Nijika Ijichi," Ryo, did you catch it?"
Ikuyo Kita," Gotoh-san, we did it!"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes!
Nijika Ijichi," It hasn't been long, but Bocchi-chan's playing is so different."
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san!
Hitori Gotou, Yes!
Ikuyo Kita," You were really incredible there, Gotoh-san."
Hitori Gotou," E-Excuse me, Kita-san!"
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san? Gotoh-san?!
Ryo Yamada, Did we just imagine that performance?
Nijika Ijichi, Did we just imagine that performance?
Ikuyo Kita, Need a glass of water?
Hitori Gotou, S-Sorry. Too many new things at once put my stomach acid into overdrive...
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, you're okay! Of course your stomach's freaked out a little!"
Ikuyo Kita, I can't believe we passed!
Ryo Yamada, I knew it from the start. I've even thought up our next song.
Ikuyo Kita, Awesome! That's my senpai!
Nijika Ijichi," Well, easy to say after it's done."
Ikuyo Kita, Let's all take a picture!
Hitori Gotou, C-Can't I clean the floor first?
Seika Ijichi, She really is good. But she's so inexperienced playing with a team that her lack of self-confidence holds her back. She could grow even more.
Hitori Gotou, Huh? Has the manager been making eye contact with me?
Seika Ijichi," To give her confidence, she needs to know someone out there acknowledges her talent."
Hitori Gotou, She's looking at me! Is she mad?! Because I let victory make me arrogant?
Seika Ijichi," Hey, kid. I see you, okay?"
Hitori Gotou, She's watching me!
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, Gotoh-san! Let's take our picture!"
Hitori Gotou, It's over.
san," Manager. Admit it. You liked them from the start. C'mon, you've been keeping a window open in the concert schedule for them. Why tease them like that?"
Seika Ijichi," I wasn't teasing. I just didn't want to put them on until they were ready. But while they're still rough around the edges, I think they've got something. As her sister, I need to be hard on her to make sure her band grows."
san, Is this what they call a sister complex?
Seika Ijichi," One more word about that, and you're fired."
san, Right.
Nijika Ijichi, Okay! Let's work even harder to level up our band in the lead-up to the concert!
Ryo Yamada, Right!
Hitori Gotou, Right!
Ikuyo Kita, Right!
Ryo Yamada," Bocchi, I'm looking forward to the new lyrics."
Hitori Gotou, R-Right!
Ikuyo Kita," Isn't this getting exciting, Gotoh-san?!"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes!
Hitori Gotou," Th-That's right! It's not over at all! In fact, Kessoku Band's journey is just getting started!"
Nijika Ijichi," Now, since the ticket quota is twenty at 1,500 yen each, that means we each sell five!"
Hitori Gotou, Five-ticket quota... Five-ticket quota?!
Ikuyo Kita," Five tickets, right? Got it!"
Hitori Gotou, Five-ticket quota?! Father...
Naoki Gotou, My daughter's inscribing her name into rock history...
Hitori Gotou, Mother...
Michiyo Gotou, I'll cook some red rice!
Hitori Gotou, Sister...
Futari Gotou," You're awesome, Sis!"
Hitori Gotou, Dog...
Dog, Woof!
Hitori Gotou," Father, mother, sister, dog! Father, mother, sister, dog! Father, mother, sister, dog! Father, mother, sister, dog! I-I... I h-have one left over!"
Ikuyo Kita," Gotoh-san is so happy, she's crying!"
Nijika Ijichi, We have to put on a great concert together!
Ryo Yamada, Yeah.
Hitori Gotou, I-It's really over this time.
Guitar man," Let's recap the show so far! Hitori Gotoh is a slightly shy, socially anxious, and isolated guitar enthusiast!"
Hitori Gotou," This guitar's my friend! But some day, I might like to join a band!"
Guitar man, And as she was thinking that...
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, come join our band!"
Guitar man," From that humble beginning, she formed a rock band with this group of colorful characters! Since then, her life has been one event after another! And just now, the club manager said, I can't put you on stage unless you pass an audition,"" which inspired a huge panic! And after hours and hours of practice..."
Ryo Yamada, Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Ikuyo Kita, Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Hitori Gotou, Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Nijika Ijichi, Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Guitar man," They managed to pass their audition! Happiness bloomed! Or so they thought, but Hitori Gotoh still had a towering wall before her! It was... That five-person ticket quota! What was a girl with no contacts outside of her family and band to do?! What will you do? What will you do, Hitori—"
Hitori Gotou, Only ten days to the concert.
Hitori Gotou," Father, mother, sister, dog. One ticket left for... Grandma? B-But I doubt she'd make the three-hour trip just to see me play..."
Michiyo Gotou," Good. You know Jimihen can't come, right?"
Hitori Gotou," Y-You think? I s-sort of had a feeling, but... I wasn't sure..."
Naoki Gotou, Futari can't go to a club like that either. She's only five.
Futari Gotou," Aw, no fun!"
Michiyo Gotou, It's scary in there.
Hitori Gotou," Mother, father. Mother, father. Mother, father. Mother, father. Mother, father. Mother, father. Mother, father. Mother, father... Mother, father... Mother, father... Mother, father... Mother, father..."
Michiyo Gotou, I could invite some of my friends. My friends. My friends. My friends.
Hitori Gotou, Mother?
Futari Gotou, It's not like Sis has friends of her own!
Hitori Gotou," I-I might not talk about them, but I've got lots of friends at school."
Futari Gotou, Lia—
Hitori Gotou," You shouldn't say that, even as a joke. You should grow up to have empathy for others."
Futari Gotou, S-Sorry.
Michiyo Gotou, Sounds like I should talk to my friends.
Naoki Gotou, Me too—
Hitori Gotou," N-N-N— N-No, that's okay! I've got lots of friends at school. S-See?! You just wait for that concert!"
Hitori Gotou," I shouldn't have bragged like that. What do I do? If I don't find buyers for three more tickets... I made these promotional flyers to hand out around my neighborhood, but..."
Guitar man, I read online that stuff with a handmade feel comes across as more charming!
Hitori Gotou, But honestly... How is someone with social anxiety supposed to hand out flyers? I feel so powerless. I'm too scared to even move.
Ikuyo Kita, Looks like lots of my friends are coming! Thank goodness!
Ryo Yamada, I got 'em sold.
Nijika Ijichi," How are you doing, Bocchi-chan? Coming today? I want to try the new song all together!"
Hitori Gotou," Th-They're all taking care of it! Wh-What do I say back? I got that quota covered! and pretend I'm okay? Or do I just admit, I can't handle the quota!? But if I do that..."
Nijika Ijichi, You can't be in the band if you can't handle your quota.
Ryo Yamada," Bye-bye, Bocchi."
Ikuyo Kita, Senpai! I searched through my extensive connections and found us an amazing and totally extroverted guitarist!
Hitori Gotou, Yeah! Rock you!
Ryo Yamada, Yeah! Rock you!
Ikuyo Kita, Yeah! Rock you!
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah! Rock you!
Hitori Gotou, Why couldn't I just accept my mom's help?!
Hitori Gotou," A p-person's collapsed. Wh-What do I do? I've got to say something... Actually, I need an ambulance!"
Hitori Gotou, H-Hello?
Phone, This is the news for 4:30 pm...
Kikuri Hiroi, W-Water... Please...
Hitori Gotou, R-Right! I'll go buy some—
Kikuri Hiroi, A-And hangover medicine.
Hitori Gotou, R-Right!
Kikuri Hiroi, And miso soup with clams... And rice porridge too... Preferably in a bed dressed with freshly line-dried sheets...
Hitori Gotou, Sh-She's very demanding.
Kikuri Hiroi," Ah, right to the liver! You're a lifesaver! Thanks so much! I didn't think you'd really buy me the miso soup!"
Hitori Gotou, I-It's nothing.
Kikuri Hiroi, I wanna take off my head and power-wash it!
Hitori Gotou, I ended up helping a very weird person.
Kikuri Hiroi, I wanna take out my guts and wring out all the alcohol!
Hitori Gotou," W-Well, I should be going..."
Kikuri Hiroi," Say, what's your name?"
Hitori Gotou, H-Hitori Gotoh.
Kikuri Hiroi, What a cute name!
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thank you.
Kikuri Hiroi," Drinking should be done in moderation, y'know? She said as she started drinking again! Hair of the dog that bit ya! So good!"
Hitori Gotou, She's still drinking. What should I do? Just leave?
Kikuri Hiroi," Ya want some too, Hitori-chan? Sorry it's the cheap stuff."
Hitori Gotou," N-No, thanks..."
Kikuri Hiroi," Wait, you're underage, right? Hey, you listenin'?"
Hitori Gotou," Yeah, she's way too weird."
Kikuri Hiroi, Why haven't ya said anything?
Hitori Gotou, I can't tell if she's serious or playing dumb.
Kikuri Hiroi," Hitori-chan, you're cold as ice! Like concrete!"
Hitori Gotou," On the count of three, I book it!"
Kikuri Hiroi, Wh-Whaddya want? Ya want some booze after all?
Hitori Gotou, I sh-should be going...
Kikuri Hiroi," Hey, a guitar! Do ya play? I'm in a band too! Indie, of course."
Hitori Gotou, Sh-She plays too?!
Kikuri Hiroi," Hey, can ya play?"
Hitori Gotou," I'm s-s-s-so scared! I've never talked to a grown-up rocker before! I d-don't know why, but I bet she'll be mad!"
Kikuri Hiroi," Lemme see! Lemme see! Sheesh, kids these days... You don't know what rock is!"
Hitori Gotou, I have to get out of here before I say something stupid.
Kikuri Hiroi," What's with you, Hitori-chan?"
Hitori Gotou," A-A-A-Actually I bought it but gave up after one day, so I was just heading to a pawn shop to sell it!"
Kikuri Hiroi, Uh?
Hitori Gotou," I was hoping for a far more worthy person to use this guitar and truly find their wings and soar, but I d-d-don't play at all! Sorry! Gosh, wonder how much I'll get for it! It's all-you-can-eat yakiniku for me today!"
Kikuri Hiroi," Wait! Giving up after one day is a waste. You can sell it any time you want. But if you stick with it a little while longer, you might become worthy of that guitar someday. Oh, listen to me! Tryin' to sound all wise..."
Hitori Gotou, Wait. Is she kind of normal after all?
Kikuri Hiroi," Oh, I know. How's about I give you lessons?"
Hitori Gotou," Oh, actually, sorry... I lied about everything I said just now."
Kikuri Hiroi, That's a heck of a smooth lie you told.
Kikuri Hiroi," Wow, nice guitar! It's clear you take good care of it."
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thank you.
Kikuri Hiroi," I play bass. Booze and the bass are worth more to me than my life, so I always keep them close by."
Hitori Gotou," So, uh... Where's your bass?"
Kikuri Hiroi," I left it at the pub. Let's go grab it, Hitori-chan!"
Hitori Gotou, She values her life so little...
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, hey. Have you heard back from Bocchi-chan?"
Ryo Yamada, Still left on read.
Nijika Ijichi, Maybe we shouldn't have sent those LOINEs.
Ikuyo Kita, I don't think that's it. Today's our practice day. I'm sure she's just busy.
Nijika Ijichi, You think? But what if we overwhelmed her?
Ryo Yamada, I get how she feels. I've felt that pressure so many times myself.
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, right! Sheesh... Boy, I sure hope she's okay!"
Kikuri Hiroi, Ta-dah! My very own bass! Super Ultra Shuton Doki EX!
Hitori Gotou, Th-This is all too incomprehensible. I'm struggling.
Kikuri Hiroi," Cool, huh?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes. Very cool.
Kikuri Hiroi," We really rocked the house at our concert last night! But I drank way too much at the afterparty. Next thing I knew, the sun was up, and I had no idea where I was!"
Hitori Gotou, H-How many hours did you spend drinking?
Kikuri Hiroi," Lesse... The afterparty started at ten, so... I was pretty out of it most of the time, so... Figure I might as well stay up 'til tonight."
Hitori Gotou, Y-You really like drinking that much?
Kikuri Hiroi," Sure do! Drinking lets me forget everything, so I just..."
Hitori Gotou, Everything?
Kikuri Hiroi," You know, like fears about the future. Pension problems! Rural depopulation! The poverty gap! Fears about the future Caregiving Pension crisis Stressful society Low wages Marriage Loss of lifetime careers Depression Job searches Rural depopulation Helplessness Old age Poverty gap Life is pain More, more! Body builds up tolerance, gotta drink more Craving is temporarily satisfied Happiness Spiral Unable to think of anything but alcohol I'm out of alcohol! The alcohol is gone! fidget fidget Gotta get booze! I call it a Happiness Spiral!"
Hitori Gotou, Um...
Hitori Gotou, What a sad kind of happiness.
Kikuri Hiroi," Doesn't ring true, huh? You'll understand when you're older, Hitori-chan."
Hitori Gotou, A-Actually...
Hitori Gotou, I'd really rather I didn't!
Kikuri Hiroi," You'll be super into drinking, I bet! I can tell just by looking at your face!"
Hitori Gotou, I wonder what I'd look like drunk...
Hitori Gotou," Mom's stopped bugging me to go to the employment agency. Bet she's too busy with her grandkids. Futari's a mama now, after all. I know it's not good for things to stay this way, but I don't see how I could pull myself together now. Those high school days in the band... Feels like a lifetime ago. Boy, I sure was shining back then... Wonder what they're all up to now. But what would I even say if I saw them?"
Hitori Gotou, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Kikuri Hiroi," Wow, you're pretty messed up, too!"
Hitori Gotou, S-S-Sorry. I lost my head.
Kikuri Hiroi," That's okay. I kinda like it. By the way, what were ya doing?"
Hitori Gotou," A-Actually... Lorem ipsum, yada yada, etc etc, blah blah blah..."
Kikuri Hiroi," Ah, I see! I never knew you lived such a tragic life!"
Hitori Gotou, Sh-She's really sympathetic!
Kikuri Hiroi, Selling tickets is so hard. I really struggled with it at the start too!
Hitori Gotou," Y-Yeah, it really is..."
Kikuri Hiroi," Okay, since you saved my life, I'm gonna put some skin in the game. Now, prepare yourself. You and I are gonna... play a street concert, right here and now!"
Hitori Gotou, S-Street concert?
Kikuri Hiroi," Yeah! You've got those flyers, after all. The best way to sell tickets is to play on the street and pick up an audience."
Hitori Gotou, B-But...
Kikuri Hiroi," Seems there's some kind of festival in the area today, so there's lots of people around. Perfect for a street performance! Oh, but we don't have amps and stuff..."
Hitori Gotou, T-Too bad! Guess we'll have to try another time...
Kikuri Hiroi," H-Hey, it's me! Yeah, I'm not dead! I was gonna play on the street, so could you bring the stuff by for that? Nah, the equipment's enough."
Hitori Gotou, Wh-What do I do? She's really going for it...
Kikuri Hiroi," Yeah. Sure, thanks! Hey, everyone! We're about to play! It's free, so come by if you can! Hey, Kanazawa-Hakkei peeps! We're about to play! Come watch!"
Hitori Gotou, Wow! I can't wait!
Kikuri Hiroi," You're playing, girl!"
Kikuri Hiroi," Huh? You've never played outside before? If you're that scared, you could shut your eyes... Or... Well, I guess you're"
Hitori Gotou," Oh, that might just work..."
Kikuri Hiroi," scared of strangers, huh? I feel you."
Hitori Gotou, I've been playing so long in the dark where I can't see my fingers anyway. Yeah. I can do it.
Kikuri Hiroi, But just so you know... You're not in combat with the people in front of you. Don't get it twisted who your enemies are.
Hitori Gotou," Enemies? What does she mean, enemies?"
Ikuyo Kita, What? What's Gotoh-san like at school?
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah. I think I can kind of picture it, but... well..."
Ryo Yamada," Is she a loner at school, too?"
Nijika Ijichi, Don't just say it like that!
Ikuyo Kita," Well, let me see... We're in different classes, so I don't see what she's like with her classmates, but... It's true that I've never seen her with another person. Oh, she's not being bullied or anything, though."
Nijika Ijichi, That's good to hear!
Ikuyo Kita, She's really withdrawn and people seem to have trouble interacting with her. It's kind of hard to know how to approach her.
Nijika Ijichi, Really?
Ryo Yamada, But Bocchi's so fun.
Ikuyo Kita," I know, right?! She'll stick with me for guitar practice, but when I invite her to have lunch with my friends, she won't come, and she's never in her classroom... She's..."
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan... I sure hope she's okay...
Kikuri Hiroi," Okay, we're starting! We're playing an original song by her band, Kessoku Band! Let's have some applause! Go on, play."
Hitori Gotou," R-Right... She's ad-libbing, but she's really selling it. Her playing is so confident. She's giving me such a firm foundation to play from. Just from hearing her play, I can tell she's having fun. By comparison, I... I wonder if they're all laughing at me out there. I'm too scared to look up."
s Fans," You're doing great! Hey, what are you doing? Well... The guitar girl seemed nervous, so it just came out. Just came out?"
Hitori Gotou, I see. I never had any enemies here. It was just my imagination.
Kikuri Hiroi, She opened her eyes. Her playing is suddenly more stable. So this is how Hitori-chan plays. Interesting. That's right. The only people here are the ones who stopped to hear you play. Realizing and conquering her flaws in such a short time... Amazing! She's going to get better. My instinct never lies!
Hitori Gotou," They're all smiling. If I do more concerts, will I see more faces like these? I think I'd like that."
Kikuri Hiroi," Great work, Hitori-chan!"
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thank you.
Hitori Gotou, Wh-What a relief... She didn't realize I only had one eye open!
Kikuri Hiroi, What's wrong?
Hitori Gotou," Oh, n-nothing..."
Hitori Gotou, Sorry. I can't change everything all at once!
s Fans, Excuse me.
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes?!
s Fans, Can we buy tickets to this concert? We'll take two!
Kikuri Hiroi," Isn't that great, Hitori-chan? Huh? Did you freeze up from joy? Um... That'll be 1,500 yen apiece, 3,000 total! Right?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes! A-Are you sure you want to buy those t-t-tickets?
Kikuri Hiroi," Give it up already, Hitori-chan!"
Hitori Gotou, B-But I...
s Fans," This was my first time watching a street performance, but you were so good! Keep up the good work at your next concert, okay?"
Hitori Gotou, R-Right... I'll do my best.
s Fans, Will you be playing that song again?
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes. I will.
s Fans, Can't wait to see it!
Kikuri Hiroi," To think I had this shining period myself once... Tonight, I drown away my cares."
Hitori Gotou, Wh-Why are you crying?
Kikuri Hiroi," Sorry, sorry! I'll be back in my happiness spiral soon..."
Hitori Gotou, Th-That can't possibly be good for you.
Police, Excuse me. You guys can't play here!
Kikuri Hiroi, Sorry!
Hitori Gotou, I-It's the fuzz! Are they gonna take me away?!
Kikuri Hiroi," Of course not! They are pretty mad, though, so let's call it quits here."
Hitori Gotou," Oh, that's right. I got so carried away before, but I still have one ticket left to sell... B-But I did sell four! Not bad for my first time!"
Kikuri Hiroi," I'll buy that last one. The ticket. That'll get you to your quota, right?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-You're sure?!
Kikuri Hiroi," Of course. I typically operate out of Shinjuku, so I'm close by, and I know this club too."
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thank you so much...
Kikuri Hiroi, A concert costing over five Onikoros... It'd better be worth it!
Hitori Gotou, R-Right!
Kikuri Hiroi," Let's play together again some time! Bye-bye, Hitori-chan!"
Hitori Gotou, What a mysterious person. Rockers really are... cool.
Kikuri Hiroi, I spent the last of my money on your ticket! Can I borrow some for the train? I'll pay you back at the concert.
Hitori Gotou, This feels strangely familiar. Why are rockers all so poor?
Hitori Gotou, I'm sorry I didn't make it to practice today. Also... I sold all my tickets!
Hitori Gotou, And... send! May our concert be a big success!
Ikuyo Kita," Also, I sold all my tickets,"" she said!"
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan... She's totally lying, right?"
Ryo Yamada, Totally.
Ikuyo Kita, I bet our LOINEs really did put pressure on her.
Ryo Yamada, Poor thing.
Nijika Ijichi, Let's all be nice to her at practice tomorrow!
Ryo Yamada, Sure.
Ikuyo Kita, Right!
Nijika Ijichi," So hot! Summer's in full swing, huh?"
Ikuyo Kita, Very much so! I think we're almost at Gotoh-san's house.
Nijika Ijichi," Great! Thanks for showing me around, by the way."
Ikuyo Kita, Not at all! I'm really looking forward to this!
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah! It'll be such a new experience! I mean, we mainly only get together at Starry, right?"
Ikuyo Kita, Yes! I wonder what Gotoh-san's house is like!
Nijika Ijichi, She said something about a cramped cardboard box reminding her of home...
Ikuyo Kita, A house like a cardboard box?
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan says the funniest things, huh? I can't wait!"
Ikuyo Kita, Neither can I! I brought some sweets and a movie I like.
Nijika Ijichi," Hey! You didn't forget why we're doing this, did you?"
Ikuyo Kita," No, I remember! We're designing T-shirts for our concert, right?"
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah!
Ikuyo Kita, I wish Ryo-senpai could've come too...
Nijika Ijichi," I did invite her, but... She says her grandma took a turn for the worse."
Ikuyo Kita, Is she all right?!
Nijika Ijichi," Oh, she's fine. This is like the tenth critical time for her grandma this year."
Ryo Yamada, I love the way the guitar comes in here.
Ikuyo Kita, You mean...
Nijika Ijichi," I mean, at least her grandma really exists. That's a heckuva low bar."
Students, Let's hang out!
Nijika Ijichi," Once, when some classmates invited her to hang out with them..."
Ryo Yamada," Sorry, my dog Pe'z has to have surgery."
Students, What?!
Nijika Ijichi," So she said, but she's never even had a dog."
Ikuyo Kita, She hasn't?
Nijika Ijichi," She hasn't! Then there's ""I just got a call from my twin sister separated at birth,"" and ""my dad was in a car crash, and now he has amnesia."" Just all the silliest excuses..."
Ikuyo Kita, I'm impressed by how easily she comes up with such a wide range of lies. Senpai's amazing! I love me a bad girl!
Nijika Ijichi, That's a serious Ryo obsession right there.
Ikuyo Kita," We're here! This is it! This... is it, isn't it?"
Nijika Ijichi," It... does say ""Kessoku Band,"" right?"
Ikuyo Kita, Did she mention her house was a ryokan?
Nijika Ijichi, I'm not sure. It just looks like a normal house to me.
Ikuyo Kita, Yeah.
Nijika Ijichi, Anyway...
Nijika Ijichi," We're here, Bocchi-chan!"
Ikuyo Kita, Hello!
Hitori Gotou, C-Coming! Y-Yaaaay! W-W-Welcome!
Nijika Ijichi," Are you having fun, Bocchi-chan?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yeah... I b-b-bombed...
Ikuyo Kita, Isn't that nice? Gotoh-san's made it clear how much she's been looking forward to this too!
Hitori Gotou, Kita-san knows the kindest words to soothe my bombed soul.
Hitori Gotou, C-Come in.
Nijika Ijichi, Okay!
Ikuyo Kita, Coming in!
Ikuyo Kita," Gotoh-san, these are for you. Please enjoy them with your family."
Hitori Gotou, Wh-What? Th-Thank you...
Hitori Gotou," Ah, t-trendiness emanates from the bag! shining smells so good"
Ikuyo Kita," I brought a movie, too!"
Nijika Ijichi," I told you, we have to figure out our T-shirt design for the concert!"
Nijika Ijichi," Rather than just wearing whatever, wouldn't having matching outfits create a sense of one-ness? A sense of band-ness?! Am I wrong here? Besides..."
Seika Ijichi, There's nothing tying you guys together.
Nijika Ijichi, I know that's what she'll say! You get it? We're not here to play around!
Hitori Gotou, Th-This way... I-I'm sorry. I'll put it all away.
Nijika Ijichi," W-Well, we could play around a little!"
Ikuyo Kita," Yes, I'd love that!"
Hitori Gotou," W-Well then, I'll fetch the drinks. Please make yourselves at home."
Nijika Ijichi, Thanks!
Nijika Ijichi," But wow, she really went all-out with the decorations!"
Ikuyo Kita," There's nothing here besides the guitar and effects unit, though."
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah...
Ikuyo Kita, I just assumed her room would have a bit more of a rock feel to— Is this... rock?
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, it's pretty rock! I w-wonder if there's anything else rock about i— Ow!"
Ikuyo Kita, Huh? Why does she have so many copies of our ProPho?
Nijika Ijichi," I don't know what's going on, but it seems pretty darn rock!"
Futari Gotou, She's got blown-up ones too! She had this picture stuck up all over her room. She said she really liked it! But Mom told her to take them down because they were hurting her eyes. And we put those seals up when Sis was possessed before! That should just about cover it!
Ikuyo Kita," Wait, are you Gotoh-san's sister?"
Futari Gotou, Yes! A pleasure to meet you. I'm Futari Gotoh. The dog's Jimihen.
Hitori Gotou, I hope barley tea's okay. Or would they prefer a trendier drink?
Nijika Ijichi, So cute!
Ikuyo Kita, So cute!
Hitori Gotou, Sorry to keep you guys wa—
Futari Gotou," Hey, will you play the Munions song on guitar?"
Ikuyo Kita, I'll practice so I can do it the next time I come by.
Futari Gotou, You gotta! When's the next time you come by?
Hitori Gotou, I-Is this...
Nijika Ijichi, Jimihen's a friendly little guy!
Hitori Gotou," Th-They're getting along so well, there's no room left for me..."
Nijika Ijichi, Huh? Bocchi-chan?
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san?
Hitori Gotou, A five-year-old and a dog have better social skills than me.
Futari Gotou, Sis is frozen up again.
Hitori Gotou, F-Futari. Wh-What are you doing here? Wh-Where are Mom and Dad?
Futari Gotou, Shopping.
Hitori Gotou," I-I-I've got grown-up things to talk about, so please go play with Jimihen."
Futari Gotou," Aw, no fun!"
Ikuyo Kita, I don't mind having Futari-chan here.
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, same!"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Y-Y-You can't! I c-c-can't whoop it up if my sister's here!
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan, you've been whooping it up with us all this time?"
Hitori Gotou, I beg of you! Please go play with Jimihen! You can have an ice pop from the freezer.
Futari Gotou," Well, it is what it is!"
Ikuyo Kita, You've got such a sisterly bond!
Nijika Ijichi, How did you get that from what just happened?
Nijika Ijichi," Now, let's design those T-shirts! Feel free to use these!"
Ikuyo Kita, Okay!
Hitori Gotou, Okay...
Nijika Ijichi," We could just slap our logo on there, but I'd love to sell the shirts as merch, too!"
Hitori Gotou, N-Nijika-chan is so hungry for merch!
Nijika Ijichi," So if you have any other great ideas, I might use those as well!"
Ikuyo Kita," Okay! Let's do our best, Gotoh-san!"
Hitori Gotou, R-Right!
Hitori Gotou, I have to impress the others for once!
Nijika Ijichi," C'mon, take that stuff off before you try to look serious!"
Naoki Gotou, What? They really came?
Michiyo Gotou, Really? For real?
Futari Gotou, Yeah!
Michiyo Gotou, These friends aren't just the imaginary kind?
Futari Gotou," Yeah, yeah!"
Ikuyo Kita, All done!
Nijika Ijichi, Let me see!
Ikuyo Kita," The concept is friendship, effort, and victory!"
Nijika Ijichi, It's not a dang sports festival!
Ikuyo Kita," Aw, but I think it's cute!"
Nijika Ijichi," Hang on. What are we winning at? I'm not sure how ""victory"" applies to a concert..."
Ikuyo Kita, Um... vibes!
Nijika Ijichi, Vibes?
Ikuyo Kita," I just think wearing these would really get us feeling like a unit! Right, Gotoh-sa—"
Hitori Gotou, C-Class unity...
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan! Is the idea of a sports festival that traumatic for you?!
Hitori Gotou," The sports festival: the number one-source of school trauma for introverts. School Trauma Sources for Introverts 1st Place (Based on Japanese Introvert Society Poll) A heinous ritual in which those with no athletic ability are shunned, and even their right to exist is stripped away. Not only during school hours, but afterward too, they are forced to perform slave labor, creating banners and practicing cheers! One for all! All for one! One for all! All for one! An entire month's torturous existence living for naught but the sports festival! One for all! All for one!"
Ikuyo Kita, Looks like Gotoh-san melted.
Nijika Ijichi, It sure is hot today!
Apocalypse Classmates," No cooperation, no life!"
Hitori Gotou, But the true terror lurking behind every sports festival...
Nijika Ijichi," Wow, this week's Bocchi Time lasted through the whole commercial break!"
Ikuyo Kita, Did I do something wrong?
Nijika Ijichi," You've really put your foot in it now, Kita-chan!"
Ikuyo Kita," What? Come back, Gotoh-san!"
Apocalypse Classmates," No cooperation, no life!"
Hitori Gotou," A place in which introverts are constantly underfoot, but if they just sit quietly in a corner, they're persecuted for not being team players!"
Apocalypse Hooligan, Death to those who bring down the sports festival mood!
Apocalypse Classmates," No cooperation, no life! No cooperation, no life!"
Futari Gotou, See? They really exist!
Ikuyo Kita, Hello!
Nijika Ijichi, Thanks for having us!
Naoki Gotou, Isn't it wonderful? I never imagined Hitori would have real friends over!
Michiyo Gotou," Eat your fill, all right?"
Nijika Ijichi, Sure!
Ikuyo Kita, Thanks so much!
Naoki Gotou," You let Hitori join your band, right?"
Ikuyo Kita, Yes.
Nijika Ijichi," We didn't exactly ""let"" her join. I asked her to join, and she was willing to humor me."
Michiyo Gotou, Really?
Naoki Gotou," See? Music really brings people together! Right, Jimihen?"
Michiyo Gotou," She doesn't cause too much trouble with her retreats into her own little world, does she?"
Ikuyo Kita," Aw, that's no trouble at all!"
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah! It's fun!
Michiyo Gotou, Nice to hear.
Naoki Gotou," Here, it's done."
Hitori Gotou," The fact that I'm still upset about school festivals makes me realize I'm a downer even more, which made everything worse..."
Michiyo Gotou, Karaage's done!
Ikuyo Kita," Wow, that looks good!"
Nijika Ijichi," Wow, that looks good!"
Naoki Gotou," That one is soy sauce with garlic, and this one is shio koji. And there's lemon and shichimi spice to taste."
Ikuyo Kita, Thanks!
Nijika Ijichi," Kita-chan, eat!"
Ikuyo Kita, Okay!
Michiyo Gotou," When she said she had friends coming, I assumed they were imaginary or hallucinations, but then, she did have that picture..."
Nijika Ijichi, Hallucinations?
Naoki Gotou," But of course, image editing software is pretty sophisticated these days..."
Ikuyo Kita, Software?
Naoki Gotou," If I might ask, you're not from some kind of friend rental servi—"
Nijika Ijichi, We're her bona fide bandmates!
Naoki Gotou," Oh, okay."
Hitori Gotou, I can't say it doesn't sound like something I'd do... but hearing Mom and Dad's ideas about me is so...
Naoki Gotou, It's just that Hitori's never brought a friend home before.
Nijika Ijichi, So Bocchi's like this even at home.
Michiyo Gotou," She's been so restless for days now. She said something about practicing decorating her room, put it all up, took it all down, and put it back up, over and over again."
Naoki Gotou," And she played a simulated game of Twister, just in case you played."
Hitori Gotou, M-Mom! Dad! You don't have to tell them all that stuff!
Michiyo Gotou, I'm glad we went shopping just in case!
Naoki Gotou," Okay, this is a day worth remembering! A friend-a-versary!"
Futari Gotou, Friend-a-versity!
Hitori Gotou, C-Cut it out already!
Michiyo Gotou, That's right. The job she said she'd gotten...
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, it's at my sister's club. Bocchi-chan mainly serves drinks to customers."
Naoki Gotou, T-To customers?!
Michiyo Gotou, T-To customers?!
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah!
Hitori Gotou, It does feel pretty weird to have friends at my house...
Michiyo Gotou, Am I dreaming?
Naoki Gotou, Amazing. Music really does cause personal growth!
Michiyo Gotou, And you were having so much fun when we burst in like that! I'm so sorry.
Naoki Gotou, Maybe we should butt out?
Futari Gotou," Hey, hey, Kita-chan! What's this?"
Ikuyo Kita, That's my favorite heartwarming movie!
Nijika Ijichi, I've always wanted to watch that one!
Michiyo Gotou, Wanna watch it all together?
Futari Gotou," Yes, please!"
Naoki Gotou, Great idea! What fun!
Futari Gotou, Yeah! So fun! So fun! Yeah!
Hitori Gotou," I don't know why, but... it feels kind of hard to go back in now..."
Hitori Gotou," We ended up watching the movie, playing games, and having nothing but fun."
Ikuyo Kita, Twister and Tycoon were so much fun to play!
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah! So much fun! And yet...
Ikuyo Kita," That's right! We still need to design our T-shirts for the concert. Oh, wait... Senpai! Gotoh-san's back to it!"
Nijika Ijichi," Oh, I know why. Watching that heartwarming seishun movie has her back in a spiral."
Ikuyo Kita, I did it again?!
Hitori Gotou," Heartwarming seishun movies: the number-one source of movie trauma for introverts, by genre. Traumatic Movie Genres for Introverts 1st Place (Based on Japanese Introvert Society Poll)"
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan! We're running out of time! Snap out of it!
Hitori Gotou," A-An ordinary girl has two hot guys trying to win her heart... But if someone that cute is ""ordinary,"" what hope is there for me?"
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san!
Nijika Ijichi, It's hopeless.
Nijika Ijichi, Ryo sent in a bunch of design ideas!
Ikuyo Kita, Let me see! I want to see!
Nijika Ijichi," C'mon! Look with us, Bocchi-chan! Wh-What in the world?"
Ikuyo Kita, Curry? Now sushi...
Nijika Ijichi, I don't get it.
Ryo Yamada, Which should I have for dinner? Fried Rice Ramen Set
Nijika Ijichi, Make your own decisions!
Ikuyo Kita, I think curry's better!
Nijika Ijichi," Kita-chan, don't actually respond!"
Hitori Gotou, E-Excuse me...
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, Bocchi-chan's back?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes... I thought you might like to see my design... What do you think?
Nijika Ijichi, S-So lame!
Hitori Gotou, I-Is it too trendy?
Ikuyo Kita, It's that mystery font I see on middle school boys' clothing all the time.
Hitori Gotou, I thought it would keep people focused on our clothing when we're playing.
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, for several reasons."
Ikuyo Kita, What's the point of all the zippers and chains?
Hitori Gotou," I thought I could use the zippers to hold picks, and the chain could serve as a guitar strap."
Nijika Ijichi, Weirdly practical!
Hitori Gotou," So, can I assume we're all in on this one?"
Ikuyo Kita, I'm not sure about that...
Nijika Ijichi, Is this what you like to wear normally?
Hitori Gotou," My mom buys my clothes, so no."
Nijika Ijichi," Oh, really?"
Hitori Gotou," I've never worn any of them, though... They're not to my taste."
Nijika Ijichi," Aw, I wanna see!"
Ikuyo Kita, Same! I've never seen you in anything but the tracksuit!
Nijika Ijichi," C'mon, please! Try one on!"
Ikuyo Kita, Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!
Nijika Ijichi, Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!
Hitori Gotou, F-Fine...
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah!
Ikuyo Kita, Yeah!
Nijika Ijichi, She's so... C-Cute!
Ikuyo Kita, She's so... C-Cute! I love it! Look right this way!
Hitori Gotou," N-No pictures, please..."
Nijika Ijichi, I knew it! Bocchi-chan's cute!
Ikuyo Kita," It's easy to forget, with how she usually is!"
Hitori Gotou, U-Um... c-can I take it off now?
Ikuyo Kita," Wait, hang on!"
Nijika Ijichi, I know! Let's brush back your bangs! That's what you need!
Ikuyo Kita, Are you growing them out?
Hitori Gotou," I j-just can't get to the salon, so they grow out..."
Nijika Ijichi, Then I'll do some styling!
Hitori Gotou," N-No, thank you!"
Nijika Ijichi," Aw, don't be shy! Bocchi-chan's turning to ash! Her body can't keep up with the sudden stress of her face being exposed! Bocchi-chan's... dead."
Ikuyo Kita, We'll have to find a new guitarist. Senpai! What's wrong?
Nijika Ijichi," I'm suddenly so dizzy... The room is so damp all of a sudden, like all the air's been sucked out of it... I breathed it in!"
Ikuyo Kita, S-So did I!
Nijika Ijichi, I-It's no use. G-Going limp...
Ikuyo Kita, Is this... Gotoh-san's curse?
Michiyo Gotou, Would anyone like dessert?
Naoki Gotou, We've got the sweets Kita-chan brought—
Nijika Ijichi, I'm sorry for trying to push through everything with positivity.
Ikuyo Kita, I'm sorry I couldn't get good at guitar. I'm sorry for being too cute.
Futari Gotou, They're all acting like Sis!
Michiyo Gotou," Dear, the salt and the seals!"
Naoki Gotou, Should I call that exorcist?
Nijika Ijichi, You'll have to do the concert yourself.
Ryo Yamada, Why?
Nijika Ijichi," And so... Since nobody had any good ideas, we're going with my T-shirt design!"
Ryo Yamada, Ta-dah.
Ikuyo Kita," I love it! Did you make this, Ijichi-senpai?!"
Nijika Ijichi, I'm pretty good at the design stuff!
Hitori Gotou, Then why didn't you just design it from the start?
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan. You look like you were just thinking, Then why didn't you just design it from the start?"
Hitori Gotou, Sh-She's psychic!
Nijika Ijichi, I'm getting pretty good at guessing what you're thinking lately!
Nijika Ijichi, Awesome! Our ties feel so much stronger now!
Ikuyo Kita," Yeah, I love it!"
Ryo Yamada, The quality of the model helps.
Ikuyo Kita," Totally! Senpai, look right here!"
Hitori Gotou," This is pretty good, though. Two days to our concert. And we worked hard to make our ties feel..."
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, looks like there's a typhoon on the way."
Nijika Ijichi, No way! This is the first I've heard of it!
Ryo Yamada, Summer weather is so fickle.
Nijika Ijichi, Seriously?
Hitori Gotou, B-But what about the concert?
Ryo Yamada, Should we make rain charms?
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah! That's our only choice! Your quota is ten each!
Hitori Gotou, R-Right!
Ikuyo Kita," Oh, it looks like it won't hit the Kanto region, though."
Nijika Ijichi," Oh, really? Whew, that's a relief!"
Ikuyo Kita, I can't wait for the show!
Ryo Yamada, Yeah.
Nijika Ijichi, I think the new song's coming together pretty well!
Hitori Gotou, U-Um...
Ikuyo Kita, Yeah! We're all sounding awesome!
Nijika Ijichi," Okay, let's get practicing!"
Hitori Gotou, Excuse me! Sh-Shouldn't we still make the rain charms? Just to be safe?
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, sure! Better safe than sorry, right?"
Ikuyo Kita, Totally!
Nijika Ijichi, I'll bring in what we need to make them.
Hitori Gotou, O-Okay!
Nijika Ijichi, I haven't made rain charms since elementary school!
Hitori Gotou," I'm used to being negative, so I always assume the worst, but..."
Ryo Yamada," Sorry, the five younger brothers I haven't seen since birth—"
Nijika Ijichi," Stop acting above it! It was your idea! You okay, Bocchi-chan?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Y-Y-Y-Yes!
Hitori Gotou, It'll be okay... I think.
Hitori Gotou, I hate it when I'm right.
Seika Ijichi, Nijika and her friends made them.
san, But the typhoon still came in the end.
Seika Ijichi," Well, it's not like rain charms actually affect the weather."
san, Even the people who bought tickets might not come at this rate. I hope they're not too heartbroken by the small crowd. They practiced so hard for this. I feel bad for them.
Seika Ijichi, Real bands get screwed over by life all the time. They need to learn to make it through any situation.
san, I've got a handkerchief.
Seika Ijichi," Oh, go away."
Ikuyo Kita, Looks like my friends can't come either.
Hitori Gotou," S-Same with my parents. M-My grandma was supposed to look after Futari, b-but now she can't come, so..."
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah. Makes sense...
Ikuyo Kita, Our audience is going to be less than half of what we expected.
Nijika Ijichi," Well, it is what it is! Let's take it in stride!"
Ikuyo Kita," Yes, of course!"
Hitori Gotou," Nijika-chan always stays so cheerful, no matter what happens."
Nijika Ijichi," C'mon, look alive there!"
Ryo Yamada, It's the low-pressure system. So sleepy...
Hitori Gotou, That's right. Even during the concert where I was just helping... She worked so hard to cheer me up when I was scared. O-Okay! For today's concert... I'm gonna bring the hype!
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan, this is a serious concert. No messing around."
Ikuyo Kita," You really like that outfit, huh?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes...
Kikuri Hiroi," Wow, look at that rain! Bocchi-chan, I'm here!"
Hitori Gotou, M-Ma'am!
Seika Ijichi," Oh, you came here for Bocchi-chan?"
Kikuri Hiroi, Heck yeah! Yay!
Hitori Gotou, Y-You know each other?
Seika Ijichi, She was my junior in college.
Kikuri Hiroi," Betcher havin' an afterparty tonight, right? Picked an izakaya yet?"
Seika Ijichi, You reek of booze!
Kikuri Hiroi," I know a good one, 'kay? 'Kay?"
Seika Ijichi, How did you become even more of a pain in the ass?
san, She's got that pain-in-the-ass quality that college students have when they'd just learned something new.
Seika Ijichi, And look at you! You're soaked!
s Fans, I'm so wet! Hitori-chan!
Hitori Gotou, The girls from our street concert! Y-You really came?
s Fans, Of course we did! We're your fans! We'll be expecting a performance powerful enough to blow away the typhoon!
Hitori Gotou, Fans...
s Fans," Y-You are Hitori-chan, right? Did we have the wrong person?"
Hitori Gotou, My fans!
Guitar man, Congrats! Congrats! Congrats!
Microphone man, Congrats! Congrats! Congrats!
Hitori Gotou, My fans!
s Fans, It is the wrong person!
Ikuyo Kita, Looks like the rain's only going to get worse.
Nijika Ijichi, Worse than this?
Ikuyo Kita, Yes...
Ryo Yamada, Maybe we should just stream it as a no-audience concert and act like it was supposed to be that way from the start.
Nijika Ijichi," We're not doing that! It's way too late to get anyone to tune in, and we've already got a couple people here..."
Hitori Gotou, I-I-I-It'll be okay! A-As long as we have p-people waiting to see us p-perform!
Nijika Ijichi, Don't you dare! She's evolved somehow...
Ikuyo Kita," It's just about start time, and there's really not many people out there..."
Nijika Ijichi," But the other bands' fans are here too, and I'm sure they'll all listen to us!"
Ryo Yamada, And I'm sure more will arrive if we start.
Concertgoer," Hey, you ever heard of this first group? Kessoku Band? Don't know. Don't care. Yeah, seems like a waste of time."
Nijika Ijichi," W-Well, we're new, so of course no one knows us! Don't let it get you down!"
Ikuyo Kita, E-Exactly!
Ryo Yamada, Don't sweat it. Don't sweat it.
Hitori Gotou, R-Right!
Nijika Ijichi," O-Okay, it's almost time! Let's do that concert, you guys!"
Ikuyo Kita, A pleasure to meet you! We're Kessoku Band! We appreciate your kind attendance in spite of this awful weather!
Nijika Ijichi," Kita-chan, that's way too polite for a rock band!"
Hitori Gotou," I want my mango box! Actually, I want to disappear altogether!"
Ikuyo Kita," Well, let's get to that first song! Please lend your ears to our original song: Guitar, Solitude, and the Blue Planet!"
Hitori Gotou, Nijika-chan's drumming feels a little slow. And Kita-san's making mistakes she didn't make in practice. Ryo-san and Nijika-chan aren't in sync at all. We're not playing the way we usually do...
Ikuyo Kita," That was ""Guitar, Solitude, and the Blue Planet""!"
Concertgoer," Yeah, what a waste of time. We should've showed up later."
Ikuyo Kita, Um...
Nijika Ijichi," Kita-chan, you need to introduce the next song!"
Ikuyo Kita," R-Right! The next is another of our original songs, and it's one we just wrote..."
Hitori Gotou, Our performance and our songs still aren't good enough. But... I refuse to let it stay this way!
Concertgoer," Hey, not bad! Yeah!"
s Fans, That was super cool! Yeah!
Kikuri Hiroi, Magnificent smugface.
Ikuyo Kita," That was our second song, ""That Band""! Now, here's our last song!"
Seika Ijichi," Nice work on the concert. This is all on my tab, so drink up."
Nijika Ijichi," Thanks, Sis! Though we don't drink..."
Kikuri Hiroi," Love ya, Senpai!"
Seika Ijichi, You pay your own way. Get off.
Ikuyo Kita," Who exactly is this woman, if I may ask?"
Kikuri Hiroi," Genius bassist and unparalleled bass-lover, Kikuri Hiroi! I left my bass at a drinking party yesterday, but I forgot which drinking party, so..."
Ikuyo Kita, Instant self-contradiction.
Ryo Yamada, I've been to a lot of your concerts.
Kikuri Hiroi," Aw, for real? You got good taste, hon!"
Ryo Yamada, You spray booze on the audience.
Kikuri Hiroi," Blind drunk concerts are the best! Sorry, forgot the words! But hey, that's how concerts go sometimes! Don't be mad, you jerks!"
Ryo Yamada, I treasure my memory of you stepping on my face.
Kikuri Hiroi," Thank you, Shinjuku! I love you mother******s!"
Ikuyo Kita, There's so much about rock I have yet to learn.
Nijika Ijichi, It might be okay not to learn all that.
Kikuri Hiroi, Glad your concert turned out well in the end!
Nijika Ijichi," For an audience of ten, sure."
Kikuri Hiroi, But every single one of 'em left happy!
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, guess so!"
Seika Ijichi," Well, keep it up, and you'll pick up fans. Work hard for your next concert. And make sure you pay your quota fee."
Nijika Ijichi, That'd be really inspiring without the last bit...
Seika Ijichi," You worked really hard today too, Bocchi-chan... Wait, why's she a husk?!"
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan, don't turn to ash!"
Hitori Gotou, I've grown so tired...
Guitar man, Congrats! Congrats!
Microphone man, Congrats! Congrats!
Seika Ijichi," That's the wrong show! Go on, order as much food as you like!"
Hitori Gotou, R-Right...
Nijika Ijichi," Watcha gettin', Bocchi-chan? I was thinking of ordering karaage!"
Hitori Gotou, S-Sounds good...
Seika Ijichi, What are you doing?
Nijika Ijichi, But this looks pretty good too!
Ikuyo Kita, Isstagramming! I'm the minister!
Seika Ijichi," Minister? What do you like so much about that, anyway?"
Ikuyo Kita, What? I guess it's like giving people a piece of the fun... Isn't everything more fun when you share it with your friends?
Ikuyo Kita, Kit-aura!
Nijika Ijichi, Nice! Use that Kita-chan power of yours to purge my sister's twisted spirit!
Ikuyo Kita, Twisted? But the manager's really nice!
Ikuyo Kita, Kit-aura! Kit-aura!
Seika Ijichi, Stop it. You're killing me.
Hitori Gotou, I-I've made up my mind. Here's the menu.
Ikuyo Kita, Thanks! Let's see... I'll have the avocado and cream cheese pinchos! And the Spanish omelette with hollandaise sauce!
Seika Ijichi, The what?
Ikuyo Kita, Here! The omelette with hollandaise.
Seika Ijichi, Hollanda-what?
Hitori Gotou, Kita-san's so fluent in trendy gibberish.
Nijika Ijichi, Nice! Nice! Keep ordering!
Hitori Gotou, I bet she can casually walk into a Starpucks. I bet she could make the most complicated orders like it was nothing.
Ikuyo Kita, I'll have the puri-puri pepero papipupepo peroppe pacina shortcake! Kit-aura!
Seika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan? What do you want?
Hitori Gotou, Oh... I w-won't be the way I usually am! I'll make a trendy choice too!
Seika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan?
Hitori Gotou," Th-Then, I'll have the M-Machu Picchu Ruins, Mississippi River, Grand Canyon San Diego hash..."
Seika Ijichi," M-Machu Picchu, Machu Picchu, Machu Picchu... Where's that exactly?"
Hitori Gotou," Oh, I read it wrong... I meant fries."
Seika Ijichi, How did you read that wrong?
Ryo Yamada, Pickled fish offals for me.
Kikuri Hiroi, How old're you again?
Seika Ijichi, You're already moving on?
Kikuri Hiroi," Izakayas are like my home ground, y'know?"
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, how do you read this one?"
Kikuri Hiroi, Which one? I don't think I can read it either...
Ikuyo Kita," You're so knowledgeable, Ryo-senpai!"
Hitori Gotou," It's my first time at an izakaya, but they're actually kind of fun... I wonder if they'll be even more fun when I grow up and can drink."
Bartender, Sure thing! One shochu!
Hitori Gotou," Is life just an unrelenting hell? If I can't make my stage debut in high school, I'm going to have to get a proper career too. I'm not smart enough to get into college, and I don't even know what I'd go for..."
Imaginary Boss," Your sales for this month were the lowest on the team, Gotoh-san. Gotoh-san again? It's partly the boss being cruel. He transferred her to sales to try to make her quit!"
Hitori Gotou," E-Excuse me... W-Would you like to buy some tokoroten? It's well-aged, and it goes down smooth... I see as plain as day where my Game of Life is going!"
Michiyo Gotou," Hitori-chan, won't you open up? Please? You don't have to go back to work. Just come eat dinner with me again! Please?"
Hitori Gotou, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Seika Ijichi, Another of Bocchi-chan's episodes?
Kikuri Hiroi," Oh, so that is typical for her!"
Hitori Gotou," If I can't make money with my guitar, I'll end up a NEET. If I can't make money with my guitar..."
Seika Ijichi, Her face is scary when it gets like that.
san, Really? I think it's got personality.
Seika Ijichi, Are you for real?
Ryo Yamada," Sandpaper, please."
Ikuyo Kita," It's kind of a chore, huh?"
Ryo Yamada, Whoops. Think I botched it.
Ikuyo Kita, It's okay. Just do it like this. See?
Seika Ijichi, They're used to it!
Ryo Yamada, Up we go. Did I make her face too long?
Ikuyo Kita, I think it's about right.
Hitori Gotou," Oh, thank you!"
Ikuyo Kita, A-Actually can I fix it up a little?
Ryo Yamada," By the way, Ikuyo. You played pretty well today for only having done this for three months."
Kikuri Hiroi, Huh? Who's Ikuyo again?
Ikuyo Kita, Dunno! Who'd have a crummy old name like that?!
Seika Ijichi," It's your name, isn't it?!"
Kikuri Hiroi," Oh, it's Kita-chan's name?"
san," That face is contagious, huh?"
Ikuyo Kita, I hid it for so long! I hate my name so much!
Seika Ijichi, How come? It's cute.
Ikuyo Kita," You wouldn't understand, since you have a beautiful name that means ""song of the stars""!"
Kikuri Hiroi, Look at her freak out!
Ikuyo Kita, But mine sounds like a bad pun! Kita! Ikuyo! (I'm here! Let's go!) Are you serious?!
Seika Ijichi, I think we broke her.
Ikuyo Kita, My full name is Kita Kita.
Ryo Yamada, Seeing you withdraw into your shell is fun.
Seika Ijichi, You're sadistic.
Kikuri Hiroi," So, as for what you were saying before... You were mumbling about supporting yourself with the guitar and becoming a NEET."
Hitori Gotou, I-I'm sorry for losing my head...
Kikuri Hiroi," Hey, nothin' wrong with it. But lemme give you some advice as your senpai in the world of bands. Just chill out and enjoy yourself!"
san," If you put the weight of success on your own shoulders all the time, you'll just make yourself miserable."
Seika Ijichi, That's right. It's important to enjoy the process of making your dream come true.
Kikuri Hiroi," By the way, Senpai, how come you suddenly quit playing?"
Hitori Gotou, Th-The manager was in a band?
Kikuri Hiroi," Oh, yah. They were super popular."
Hitori Gotou, Then wh-why...
Seika Ijichi, I got sick of bands.
Kikuri Hiroi," But you run a club. What's the deal there, huh?"
Seika Ijichi, Shut up and drink.
Kikuri Hiroi," What, I can? Thanks a bunch!"
Hitori Gotou, Nijika-chan never said a word about that... Huh? And Nijika-chan's been gone a while...
Seika Ijichi," I'm not paying for you, though."
Kikuri Hiroi, Aww...
Hitori Gotou, E-Excuse me. I have to use the restroom.
Kikuri Hiroi," Manager, keep 'em comin'!"
Hitori Gotou, E-Excuse me... Nijika-chan?
Nijika Ijichi," Oh, Bocchi-chan!"
Hitori Gotou, I-Is something the matter?
Nijika Ijichi," Nah, just getting some fresh air."
Hitori Gotou," I-It's been getting cold at night lately, huh?"
Nijika Ijichi," Sure has. Next thing we know, summer break's gonna be over!"
Hitori Gotou," I hear nothing. I know nothing. Summer break never ends. I'm not a student. Trees, water, planets, Milky Way..."
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan! Back to reality!
Hitori Gotou, S-Sorry. E-Excuse me...
Nijika Ijichi," Say... I realized something while I was watching you play today. You're guitarhero, aren't you?"
Hitori Gotou," W-Well, a-actually, n-no, about that..."
Nijika Ijichi, It was pretty obvious from the on-point way you were strumming. And I finally noticed you had the same guitar.
Hitori Gotou, No use trying to hide it now.
Hitori Gotou," Um... I am. B-But I didn't hide it on purpose. S-Since I'm anything but a hero right now... I w-wanted to wait to tell you until I fixed the way I am. E-Especially you, Nijika-chan. A-Are you shocked to find out?"
Nijika Ijichi, Nah... It made me all the more happy to have you!
Hitori Gotou, What?
Nijika Ijichi," See, I told you I had a dream before, right?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes?
Nijika Ijichi," My mom died when I was little, and my dad was never home, so my sister was pretty much my only family. But since I hated being alone, when my sis started a band, I had her take me to her clubs all the time. It all seemed so shining to me. I was never happier anywhere else. I was her inspiration for quitting her band and starting up this club. Starry is a place my sister made for me. Though I'll bet she won't admit it. So my real dream is to make a band popular enough for me and my sister and make Starry even more famous! But when I actually started my band, I spent a while thinking that it was kind of out of my reach. And everyone was so disheartened today. But every time things are looking their worst, you're the one who breaks through it for us! Bocchi-chan, you were one heck of a hero to me today. Ryo wants to use this band to finally get to play music from the heart, and Kita-chan wants to really do something with us. They've all invested their hopes in the band. That reminds me, you never actually told me what you were doing the band for now."
Hitori Gotou," I... As a guitarist, I want to make the Kessoku Band we all care so much about the best band it can be! A-And I want us to become such a popular band that we can make money and not have to finish school..."
Nijika Ijichi," That's a pretty tall order! But I accept your investment! I sure do wish you could play the way you do in your videos every time, though..."
Hitori Gotou, I'll d-do my best...
Nijika Ijichi," But now I know it for sure! Having you with us will make our dreams possible! So keep showing us more and more. Of ""Bocchi-chan's rock."" Bocchi the Rock!"
Hitori Gotou, Okay!
Hitori Gotou," Kessoku Band managed to succeed in its first full four-member concert. And so, our summer came to... a middle. That's right. We do have some break left, don't we? Until my summer break comes to an end..."
Michiyo Gotou, What lovely weather!
Hitori Gotou, I'm going to spend every single day enjoying it to its fullest.
Futari Gotou, Shake!
Hitori Gotou," Another fulfilling day... Not! It's summer break, but I'm not doing a single thing differently! I mean, playing guitar is fun and all, but... I was thinking Kessoku Band might hang out together, so I've cleared my schedule of everything but work, but... Of course, it's usually clear regardless, but... B-But keeping it clear has a totally different feel, right? Still, even at work, nobody so much as suggests hanging out..."
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan! See you at work again tomorrow!
Hitori Gotou," The members of a band usually hang out, don't they? But I guess when we're all available, we should be practicing... S-Still, just for once, I'd like to... Yeah, that's right! I can't always be passive! B-But if I bring it up, I'm the one who'll have to pick the place and time... I can't think of a plan that'll satisfy everyone! But I just have to work up the courage! I'll start with Nijika-chan! Well... It's a bit late to call now. A-Anyway, there's a lot of summer break left! I'm sure one of them will make the offer sooner or later."
Michiyo Gotou, Hitori-chan! Time to eat!
TV," What is the general theory of relativity? The general theory of relativity states that the passage of time slows in the presence of a powerful gravity well. Time slows due to curvature of spacetime caused by a powerful gravity well The black holes theorized to exist throughout space are believed to be the end state of the life cycle of massive stars. Their extreme density and high gravitational potential mean that not only matter, but even light, becomes trapped forever in their pull. The gravitational field causes time to slow so much that it nearly stops..."
Michiyo Gotou," Hitori-chan! I'm coming in! I thought I'd air out the futons while the weather's nice. Don't lie around all day, all right? You'll be back at school soon."
Hitori Gotou, But I'm in a black hole.
Futari Gotou, It's done!
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan? Acting strange?
Ikuyo Kita," Yeah. She's been staring out into space, and she's barely talked in days."
Ryo Yamada, Sounds like typical Bocchi.
Nijika Ijichi," C'mon, you can't possibly..."
Hitori Gotou, Astaxanthin. Canthaxanthin.
Nijika Ijichi, ...be exaggerating.
Ikuyo Kita," I'm not! She seemed on the verge of tears for a minute, but then she spontaneously started dancing the samba!"
Hitori Gotou, Tortilla!
Nijika Ijichi, That's not good!
Ryo Yamada, Typical Bocchi.
Ikuyo Kita, It is not!
Seika Ijichi, Hey. Could you get Bocchi-chan to knock it off?
Ryo Yamada, Eh?
Seika Ijichi, She's been making cicada graves in front of the club all day.
Nijika Ijichi, That's way too out there! What's got her freaking out like that?
Ikuyo Kita, I wonder if it's because today's the last day of summer break.
Hitori Gotou, Farewell. Farewell.
Ryo Yamada, I don't wanna go back to school either.
Seika Ijichi," Say, guys. Have you actually taken her out anywhere this summer? One time, while you were working, I asked what she was doing with her time off..."
Seika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan. What are you doing with your break when you're not working?
Hitori Gotou," Um, I... My little sister asked me to teach her guitar, so I did."
Seika Ijichi," Hey, that's nice."
Hitori Gotou, B-But...
Futari Gotou," Today I asked my sister to teach me to play guitar! I thought it was awesome how my sister stayed inside practicing, day after day! I have too many things to do and too many friends to play with over summer break, so I can't stay home practicing every day like her! That's why I think it's awesome!"
Hitori Gotou," H-Her words sent me into a spiral, and I ended up not getting out of bed for days."
Seika Ijichi, I see.
Hitori Gotou, I cleared my schedule! N-Not because I have nothing to do! I cleared it on purpose!
Seika Ijichi, R-Right.
Seika Ijichi, She said all that.
Nijika Ijichi, Why didn't you tell us earlier?
Ikuyo Kita," I wanted to invite her, but... My schedule's packed every day I'm not here, and I thought she'd be uncomfortable around people she doesn't know, so... What about you, Ijichi-senpai?"
Nijika Ijichi," W-Well, when we're not practicing, I'm cleaning up at home or working here, so..."
Ikuyo Kita, R-Ryo-senpai?
Ryo Yamada, I figured you two had invited her already.
Nijika Ijichi, Y-You're telling me...
Ryo Yamada, Nobody invited Bocchi-chan out?
Nijika Ijichi, Nobody invited Bocchi-chan out?
Ikuyo Kita, Nobody invited Bocchi-chan out?
Seika Ijichi, You guys need to change your band name.
Ikuyo Kita, G-Gotoh-san! You want to hang out?
Hitori Gotou, Docosahexaenoic acid. Eicosapentaenoic acid.
Ikuyo Kita," Come back to us! I know! Let's all go to the beach together, right now! We could hit up Enoshima!"
Nijika Ijichi, Great idea! It's a straight shot from Shimo-Kita.
Hitori Gotou, B-But... What-about-our-practice-then?
Ryo Yamada, Why's she talking like a robot?
Nijika Ijichi," We can practice any time! It's not like we have our next concert scheduled, anyway."
Ikuyo Kita, Let's use our last day of summer break to make memories together!
Hitori Gotou, Memories...
Ikuyo Kita, Isn't that a great idea? Let's go to the beach together!
Ryo Yamada, But it might be too late to swim.
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yeah... no point in going to the beach if you can't swim.
Ikuyo Kita, B-But there's still the beach shacks!
Nijika Ijichi, Let's eat shirasu-don! And we can gaze at the ocean from the sand...
Hitori Gotou, Ocean... Sand...
Nijika Ijichi, See? Doesn't that sound fun?
Guitar man, Wait for me!
Guitar woman, You catch up!
Guitar man," The end of summer, huh?"
Guitar woman, Let's come again next year.
Guitar man, Tropical love forever!
Hitori Gotou, Tropical love...
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san!
Hitori Gotou, Forever...
Nijika Ijichi, Why is this happening?
Ikuyo Kita, I think I made it worse somehow.
Nijika Ijichi, Okay! Let's take her out while she's docile!
Ryo Yamada, Roger!
Nijika Ijichi," Kita-chan, you carry Bocchi-chan!"
Ikuyo Kita, What?!
Nijika Ijichi, Okay! Let's get going to Enoshima!
Ryo Yamada, Yeah!
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san! We'll be making those summer memories soon! Just hang in there a little longer!
Hitori Gotou, Scary... Tropical...
Hitori Gotou, I'm in a black hole... at the far reaches of the galaxy... Too far for the sunshine of summer to reach... Trapped by the powerful gravity...
Nijika Ijichi, She must really hate school to be acting this way.
Ryo Yamada, Is your school super strict?
Ikuyo Kita," No, I'd say it's on the liberal side. And the culture festivals are lots of fun!"
Nijika Ijichi," Aw, lucky! Our school's pretty strict, and the culture festivals are super uptight. It's mostly science project posters and stuff."
Ikuyo Kita," Really? That's right. Shimo-Kitazawa High is a prep school, isn't it? You two must be really smart!"
Nijika Ijichi," I'm pretty average, myself... And Ryo is... yeah."
Ikuyo Kita, Eh?
Nijika Ijichi," You bombed your last round of tests, right?"
Ryo Yamada, Yep.
Ikuyo Kita, Eh?
Nijika Ijichi, She picked the school for the same reason I did: because it was close to home!
Ryo Yamada, Yep.
Ikuyo Kita, But then how did you pass the entrance exam?
Nijika Ijichi," Ryo's a cram-the-night-before type. She worked really hard right before the exam, but apparently forgot it all after."
Ryo Yamada," When I study too hard, I forget how to play bass."
Ikuyo Kita, Which means Ryo-senpai isn't mysterious and thoughtful at all... No! Her brain is so small you can hear it rattling around in her skull!
Nijika Ijichi, Maybe we can use that sound in a new song!
Ikuyo Kita, Stop it! Stop destroying my fantasy!
Ryo Yamada, Don't yell on the train.
Ikuyo Kita, I'm deleting this conversation from my memory!
Nijika Ijichi, Is this what overly strong love does to you?
Hitori Gotou, C-Curvature of spacetime...
Nijika Ijichi," What are you seeing right now, Bocchi-chan?"
Ryo Yamada, I don't get why she's so isolated at school. She's so fun.
Nijika Ijichi, Right? I wish everyone at her school could see how cool she is.
Ikuyo Kita, I'll make sure to talk to her when school starts again.
Nijika Ijichi, You totally should! Bocchi-chan's dream right now is to drop out of school!
Ikuyo Kita, Does that even count as a dream?!
Nijika Ijichi," Anyway, let's use today to make a fun summer memory with Bocchi-chan!"
Ikuyo Kita," Let's take a picture, Gotoh-san!"
Ryo Yamada, I'm gonna get some sea salt soft-serve. See you later.
Nijika Ijichi, Hey! No one said this was free time!
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san. Please wake up already! Gotoh-san!
Nijika Ijichi, Look! The beach is so big!
Hitori Gotou, H-Huh? Wh-When did I...
Nijika Ijichi, You've really been out cold this whole time?
Hitori Gotou," Th-Thank you, Kita-san."
Hitori Gotou," When was the last time I've been to the beach? Now that I'm here, I can see how beautiful it—"
Beach Shack Clerk," Hey, girls! Come eat at our beach shack! We got a discount for cuties like you!"
Hitori Gotou, I-It's a party animal in the flesh!
Beach Shack Clerk, We can get you a table for four right away! Are y'all in high school? Where'd you come from?
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan exploded!
Ryo Yamada, Archetypal beach bros.
Nijika Ijichi, They're too powerful for us to handle!
Ikuyo Kita," Let's get away from the beach, ASAP!"
Ikuyo Kita," Here, for you, Gotoh-san."
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thanks... What is this?
Ikuyo Kita, Takosen! I hear they press the takoyaki with a full ton of force!
Hitori Gotou, A ton of force? It's good!
Ryo Yamada, My tastiness sensor never fails.
Hitori Gotou, V-Very impressive!
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan, I'm just glad to see you feeling better!"
Ikuyo Kita, It's so big and cute! So photogenic!
Nijika Ijichi, Let's take a picture!
Ikuyo Kita, Okay! Here comes the selfie!
Nijika Ijichi, Lemme see!
Ikuyo Kita, It turned out super great!
Hitori Gotou, I ate tako senbei with them. Summer memories...
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thank you... Thank you for today. It's been wonderful.
Nijika Ijichi, How are we at the climax already?!
Hitori Gotou," And so, my summer came to an end."
Ikuyo Kita, We're just getting started!
Ikuyo Kita, Okay! Let's climb all the way to the top!
Ryo Yamada, Stairs?
Ikuyo Kita, Is there anything more beautiful than scenery you have to work to see?
Ryo Yamada, No. Screw that.
Ikuyo Kita, Let's do it!
Ryo Yamada, No!
Ikuyo Kita," You too, Gotoh-san! You'll come with me, right, Ijichi-senpai?"
Nijika Ijichi, I'm not super into it either... Kita-chan! She's glowing more than ever!
Ryo Yamada, H-How?
Hitori Gotou, P-Perhaps her usually understated extrovert aura h-has been amplified by the light of the sun!
Nijika Ijichi," It's stripped off her limiter, you mean?!"
Ikuyo Kita," Come on! Let's do it! Hurry up, everyone!"
Ikuyo Kita, Kit-aura
Ryo Yamada, I'm done. No more climbing.
Nijika Ijichi, Kita-chan's getting further and further ahead...
Nijika Ijichi, I'm out!
Ryo Yamada, Who cares about the view? Not me.
Ikuyo Kita," Hang in there, you two. We've only just started!"
Nijika Ijichi, Lemme take a break first.
Ikuyo Kita, What'll I do with you?
Nijika Ijichi," You've got so much energy, Kita-chan..."
Hitori Gotou, E-Escar... I th-think we can ride an escalator up!
Ikuyo Kita," C'mon, let's climb the stairs!"
Ryo Yamada, It costs money?
Ikuyo Kita," You need to buy tickets to the Enoshima Escar. See, we should climb the stairs instead!"
Enoshima Escar Clerk, Welcome!
Ryo Yamada," I... I have no money, but... I've got some pretty good bass guitars. I'll give you one."
Enoshima Escar Clerk," Um, I don't think..."
Ryo Yamada, How about two? You want three?!
Enoshima Escar Clerk, You need to buy a ticket...
Nijika Ijichi, What a breeze!
Ikuyo Kita, But climbing the stairs would have made the view so much more impressive.
Hitori Gotou," Y-You'll pay me back next month, right?"
Ryo Yamada, I've never broken a promise in my life.
Hitori Gotou," You didn't pay me back last time, though."
Nijika Ijichi," Sorry, Bocchi-chan! I'll take it out of her paycheck."
Ryo Yamada, You're inhuman!
Nijika Ijichi, We made it!
Ikuyo Kita," As long as we're here, let's hit up the observation deck!"
Nijika Ijichi, Even taking the Escar is kind of exhausting.
Ryo Yamada, It was... quite a long way.
Hitori Gotou, Yeah...
Ryo Yamada, But being up this high feels quite liberating.
Hitori Gotou, P-Positivity wells up within me.
Ryo Yamada, That's the fresh air and magnificent view at work!
Hitori Gotou, Sh-Should we take a picture together?
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah! Cheese!
Ryo Yamada, Cheese!
Ikuyo Kita, They're finally getting into it.
Girlfriend, Look! Isn't it pretty?
Boyfriend," Yeah, sure."
Girlfriend, Hey. Aren't you listening?
Boyfriend," Oh, sorry. You're just so pretty I forgot everything else!"
Girlfriend, You silly!
Boyfriend, Miitan!
Girlfriend, Takkun!
Boyfriend, Miitan!
Ikuyo Kita, The observation deck!
Girlfriend, Takkun!
Ikuyo Kita, Let's go to the observation deck!
Ikuyo Kita, Look at that! The view from the observation deck is even more fabulous! We've really got to drink it all in!
Nijika Ijichi, I love air conditioning.
Ryo Yamada, It's heaven.
Hitori Gotou, S-Sure is.
Ikuyo Kita," Err, You guys?"
Ryo Yamada," Long, long ago, humans attempted to build a tower to heaven to prove themselves equal to God. God, enraged, scrambled the languages of humans, and cast their lands into chaos."
Nijika Ijichi, Talking about the Tower of Babel?
Hitori Gotou, B-But humans failed to learn and built another tall tower like this?
Ikuyo Kita, Guys! The scenery!
Nijika Ijichi," Kita-chan got what she wanted, so let's blow this joint."
Ikuyo Kita, G-Good idea.
Ryo Yamada, My favorite part was the air conditioning.
Ikuyo Kita, You filthy indoor types!
Nijika Ijichi, Ryo. Weren't you eating sea salt soft-serve earlier?
Ryo Yamada, I've always got room for ice cream.
Hitori Gotou," P-Please pay me back for the ice cream, too."
Ikuyo Kita, What should we do next?
Nijika Ijichi," I think we've had plenty of fun, don't you?"
Ikuyo Kita, You think? I feel like we need one more memorable event...
Nijika Ijichi," I wanna eat shirasu-don, then! They were sold out at the place where we had lunch!"
Ryo Yamada, Nah. Too full.
Nijika Ijichi, Since when were you in charge?
Hitori Gotou, What's that sound?
Nijika Ijichi," Oh, the kites?"
Ikuyo Kita," They like to steal human food, so—"
Nijika Ijichi," Right as we were talking about it! You okay, Bocchi-chan?"
Ikuyo Kita," Gotoh-san, you want my ice cream?"
Nijika Ijichi, They're targeting Bocchi-chan!
Kite, She looks weak! It pisses me off. Teach her a lesson!
Ryo Yamada, Even birds look down on her.
Ikuyo Kita," Even birds?! Gotoh-san, you okay?"
Hitori Gotou, It's over.
Nijika Ijichi, Get lost!
Ryo Yamada, Memorable event achieved.
Ikuyo Kita, That's not the kind of memorable I wanted!
Nijika Ijichi," But we can't stay out too late, so we really should head out. Bocchi's in bad shape, anyway."
Ikuyo Kita, Then how about a shrine visit before we head home?
Ikuyo Kita, This shrine is dedicated to a goddess called Myo-on Benzaiten. She's the goddess of music and performing arts. I've always thought we should come here if we ever went to Enoshima together.
Nijika Ijichi, We'll have to wish for our band's future success!
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan. You looked like you were wishing pretty hard back there.
Ryo Yamada, It took forever.
Ikuyo Kita, What were you wishing for?
Nijika Ijichi," I was wishing and thanking her pretty hard too! Goddess, thanks for making our concert a success. Keep that good fortune coming!"""
Hitori Gotou, R-Really?
Nijika Ijichi, Let's get back to practice tomorrow! Even though we don't have a next concert scheduled!
Hitori Gotou," I can't tell them... Please, Goddess! Turn back time to the first day of summer! I'll do anything, just turn back time! Either that, or give me fame and fortune so that I never go hungry! ...that I made a really vapid wish!"
Nijika Ijichi," It's about an hour from here to Shimo-Kita, right?"
Ikuyo Kita," Yeah. Gotoh-san, you'll change trains at Fujisawa, right?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yes.
Ryo Yamada, Wake me up at Shimo-Kita.
Ikuyo Kita," Oh, they're hopeless! I really wish we'd gotten to do some Kamakura sightseeing, and I wish we'd had dinner together, too!"
Nijika Ijichi, Shirasu-don...
Ikuyo Kita," She really wanted to eat that, huh?"
Hitori Gotou, My first long trip in a while... That was lots of fun. I almost wish we could've stayed out a little longer.
Ikuyo Kita," Okay! Let's spend all of winter break hanging out as Kessoku Band! Where do you want to go, Gotoh-san? Let's make memories together every single day!"
Hitori Gotou, I d-don't wanna go outside every day!
Hitori Gotou, I'll th-think about it...
Ikuyo Kita," Sure! You can rest if you want, Gotoh-san. I'll wake you up."
Hitori Gotou," A-Actually, I spent the whole train ride up here unconscious, so I'm pretty alert now."
Ikuyo Kita, Really? Then the fun continues until Fujisawa!
Hitori Gotou, H-Hey... Kita-san? I e-enjoyed hanging out with you all today. I th-think I can face school starting tomorrow. Probably.
Ikuyo Kita," Really? I'm glad to hear it! Let's enjoy the new term together, too!"
Hitori Gotou, Sure.
Hitori Gotou, This memory of summer will fuel me through to winter break.
Michiyo Gotou, Hitori-chan! It's morning! I'm coming in! You're still in bed? You'll be late to school your first day back!
Hitori Gotou, Don't feel good. Wanna stay home.
Michiyo Gotou," Oh, Hitori-chan. Lying again just to get out of school!"
Hitori Gotou, N-No...
Michiyo Gotou," Help me out, Futari!"
Hitori Gotou," M-My muscles are so sore, I can't even move!"
Futari Gotou," Okay! Wake up, Sis!"
Hitori Gotou," No, no, no, no!"
Ikuyo Kita, Morning!
s Friends," Morning! Hey, Kita-chan, I saw your Issta photos of Enoshima!"
Ikuyo Kita, Really? Thanks!
Imaginary Staff, Emergency! Emergency! The band we had scheduled can't perform! Are you kidding?! How will we find a replacement?
Hitori Gotou, Perhaps I could be of some assistance?
Imaginary Staff," Y-You're... I forget the name, but the girl from Class 2—"
Hitori Gotou, The name's Gotoh.
Crowd, Gotoh-sama! Hold me! You're a living national treasure! Gotoh! Gotoh! Gotoh! Gotoh!
Culture Festival Planner," ...six votes for a haunted house, and two votes for a candy shop."
Hitori Gotou," How long have I been out? I think I was in homeroom, and they started talking about festival project ideas... It's no use. Everything after the word unity came up is a blank."
Culture Festival Planner," Okay! So by majority vote, Class 2's project will be a maid and butler cafe! We'll have to get lots of maid uniforms!"
Hitori Gotou, M-Maid?
Culture Festival Planner, Since all the girls'll be wearing them!
Hitori Gotou," All the girls?! Does that include... me? N-No way! Too far outside my skill set! Maybe if it was a grave cafe... A-Afterlife for two... Souvenirs from the grave available... Crud, that was close. I almost spaced out again."
Culture Festival Planner," And if anyone wants to perform on the second day of the culture festival, make sure you put one of these forms in the box in front of the student council room."
Hitori Gotou," Perform on-stage as a band... I never got to do it in middle school. But I daydreamed about it a thousand times, so same thing, right? You feelin' the hype, arena? Besides, I play in real venues now! My band's not for fun and games! It's serious business!"
Students," If someone from our class played, they'd be the coolest person ever! Totally!"
Hitori Gotou," How'd I end up at the student council room?! What's this piece of paper? A band performance application... Kessoku Band... Who wrote all this?! What? Hitori Gotoh wrote it?! I'm a professional guitarist now! Begone, lust for culture festival attention! Focus on your band's career! Good... the lust is fading."
Student Council President, What was that? Teacher! Someone's collapsed out here!
Hitori Gotou, An unfamiliar ceiling.
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, you're awake? How are you feeling?"
Hitori Gotou, I'm f-fine.
Ikuyo Kita," I heard you collapsed, so I got worried."
Hitori Gotou, S-Sorry.
Ikuyo Kita, What's the matter?
Hitori Gotou, N-Nothing...
Hitori Gotou," Wh-What do I do? If I tell Kita-san, she'll get all excited, eyes sparkling, and insist that we do it! I m-must avoid that!"
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thank you for coming. I-I'll head to work after a little more rest. D-Don't worry about me.
Ikuyo Kita, But won't you be lonely?
Hitori Gotou," I'll b-b-be fine! Y-You've got plans with friends today, right?"
Ikuyo Kita," Sure, but I can cancel them!"
Hitori Gotou, I'll b-b-be fine!
Ikuyo Kita," You're sure? Well, just take it easy, okay?"
Hitori Gotou," I'd really like to perform, but I've barely done a real concert, so it's still really scary. Although... Now that I think about it, all the performers in a high school culture festival are amateurs. I wonder what the vibe is like..."
Hipster Kid," Y'all What's up, y'all? Ready to feel the hype?! Yeah! We're We're gonna make one hell of a memory today! gonna make a memory today! Join me on this journey! me!!"
Hitori Gotou," Nope. I'm so worn out, I can't even watch the concert. But a loner-type shining at the culture festival is a classic trope! So maybe I can do it too?!"
Culture Festival Announcer," Next up, Kessoku Band performs! On drums, Nijika Ijichi from Shimo-Kitazawa High!"
Crowd, Wah!  Squee!  So pretty!  So cute!  Look at me!  Waaah!  Wahhh!
Nijika Ijichi, Hi there!
Culture Festival Announcer," And Ryo Yamada, from the same!"
Ryo Yamada, Mini-bow.
Culture Festival Announcer," And on lead guitar, from Class 2... Um... Oh, Gotoh-san! And on guitar and vocals, from Class 5, our school star, Kita-chan!"
Crowd, So cute!  Eee!  Squee!  Waaaaah!  Eee!  Eeee! Waaah!
Culture Festival Announcer, It's Kita-chan!
Crowd, We love you!
Ikuyo Kita," Thanks, guys!"
Crowd, Kita-chan!                    Kita-chan!
Hitori Gotou, The fervor gap is too intense! Yeah. Not happening. I gotta know my place.
Hitori Gotou," Good morning, Manager."
Seika Ijichi," Uh, could you do some work? If you're already on the fence, I think you should do it. These high school years will be gone before you know it."
Hitori Gotou," Yeah, maybe..."
Seika Ijichi," Not that I'd know, since I barely cared about high school."
san, I dropped out!
Hitori Gotou, I asked the wrong people.
san, I could never drag myself out of bed in the morning!
Nijika Ijichi, Huh? Bocchi-chan's talking to Sis? That never happens.
san, She's waffling about her culture festival.
Nijika Ijichi, Culture festival?
Seika Ijichi, She's trying to figure out if Kessoku Band should perform there.
Nijika Ijichi, Performing at a culture festival? Sounds awesome! Let's do it!
Hitori Gotou, Um... But...
Nijika Ijichi, It's fun in a different way from performing at a club.
Hitori Gotou," Y-You've done it before, Nijika-chan?"
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, in middle school."
Ryo Yamada, Same. I played obscure songs and totally bombed with the audience!
Nijika Ijichi, Why do you sound proud of that?
Nijika Ijichi," I've never played with Ryo at a culture festival, though, so I'd love to play at this one!"
Hitori Gotou, Really?
Nijika Ijichi," Well, we only recently formed Kessoku Band."
Ryo Yamada," I'd like to play my original songs somewhere other than here, too."
Nijika Ijichi," Plus, it's a great chance to advertise ourselves!"
Hitori Gotou, But... Don't you get expelled for playing something other than seishun rock at a high school culture festival?
Nijika Ijichi, Of course not!
Ryo Yamada," I get why Bocchi's scared, though. There's a chance—a likelihood, rather—that you'll be playing in front of a large crowd. So you don't have to rush to a decision."
Hitori Gotou, Ryo-san...
Ryo Yamada," To be honest, I still have nightmares about that concert I bombed."
Seika Ijichi, So you were just acting strong earlier?
Nijika Ijichi," Either way, just make sure you don't have any regrets, Bocchi-chan."
san, Wise words.
Hitori Gotou, G-Got it. I'll think it over.
Nijika Ijichi," Right, right!"
Hitori Gotou," Nijika-chan wants to play at the culture festival too. I bet it'd feel pretty darn good... I... I just can't do it! I'm sorry, everyone. I thought I could do it yesterday, but I can't. B-But Nijika-chan told me to make sure I don't have any regrets, and if I blow it, I don't think I could make it through the rest of high school... I'm already nervous about playing in a club. The thought of being on stage at a festival... Yeah, just not happening."
Imaginary News," Skyrocketing to fame! Let's look into the members of Kessoku Band! The unexpected past of super-popular guitarist Hitori Gotoh, whose cool personality, skillful playing, and raw lyrics have captured the hearts of fans! Hitori Gotoh Q. Did you know your high school classmate Hitori Gotoh has become a famous guitarist? Wow, Gotoh-san was in a band back then? I should've gotten her autograph!"
Hitori Gotou," I'll just follow that model instead! I like it. Now that I've got a plan in mind, I don't feel so bad about it. Good work, me!"
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san! Morning!
Hitori Gotou, G-Good morning...
Ikuyo Kita," How are you feeling? I got worried and stopped by the nurse's office again yesterday, but you were already gone."
Hitori Gotou, R-Really? I'm sorry...
Ikuyo Kita," Oh, and I turned it in. For the culture festival performance! We'll be on stage as Kessoku Band! I just can't wait! The application must've fallen in the trash can by mistake. What a close call, right? Let's put on the best culture festival concert ever!"
Nijika Ijichi, So that's why she's been like that.
Ikuyo Kita, I was so sure she wanted to do it.
san, She seemed very excited yesterday.
Ikuyo Kita, Wh-What do I do? I am a criminal.
Seika Ijichi, Right?
Ikuyo Kita, They're going to label me a murderer!
Ryo Yamada," It's not too late to back out, is it?"
Ikuyo Kita, They said you can't take it back once you've applied... But I'll talk to them tomorrow.
Kikuri Hiroi," Hey-ho! Free booze, please!"
Seika Ijichi, Hell no. Piss off.
Kikuri Hiroi," Aw, c'mon! Tell yer sister to be nicer! You like havin' me around, right, li'l sis?"
Nijika Ijichi, Kindly depart. We're about to open for business.
Kikuri Hiroi, You've got a death glare on par with Senpai's lately. Bocchi-chan! What's with her? Somethin' on her mind?
Ikuyo Kita, I volunteered us for the culture festival against her will.
Kikuri Hiroi, What? You gonna play there?
Hitori Gotou," I c-can't do it. Th-There'd be so many more people than I'm used to, a-and I'm s-scared of performing in front of people who know me at s-school."
Kikuri Hiroi, Bocchi-chan. For you! Payin' you back for before. My band's playin' a gig tonight! Wanna come see?
Hitori Gotou, C-Can I?
Kikuri Hiroi, Course you can! Same goes for all y'all.
Ryo Yamada, Thank you very much.
Nijika Ijichi, Let me pay you.
Ikuyo Kita," Yes, for the tickets."
Kikuri Hiroi," Aw, don't go there. It's a gift!"
Nijika Ijichi, But...
Ikuyo Kita," Please, let us pay!"
Kikuri Hiroi," H-Hang on, do you think I'm some kind of broke rocker who's gotta hustle money from teenage girls?"
Nijika Ijichi, You mean you're not?
Kikuri Hiroi," Damn it! Senpai, one bottle of shochu!"
Seika Ijichi," Like hell, dumbass."
Kikuri Hiroi," Anyhoo, it's fine! I might not look it, but our band's pretty popular on the indies circuit! Right?"
Ryo Yamada," Yes, they have many hardcore fans."
Kikuri Hiroi," Which means we make our ticket quotas, easy! We even make money on merch!"
Nijika Ijichi," Then why do you only drink the cheap stuff? And you use our shower, too."
Seika Ijichi, Pay rent.
Hitori Gotou, You never paid me back for your train fare.
Seika Ijichi, Sounds like a hustle to me!
Kikuri Hiroi, Th-There's a reason for all this... All my money goes to paying for the equipment I break while playing drunk.
Seika Ijichi," So it's your own fault. Bocchi-chan, has she borrowed any more money from you that she hasn't paid back?"
Hitori Gotou, N-No... she hasn't...
Seika Ijichi, Garbage humans. Apologize for your late repayment.
Kikuri Hiroi, Sorry for our lateness!
Ryo Yamada, Sorry for our lateness!
Hitori Gotou, I-It's okay...
Kikuri Hiroi, Noguchi-sensei... farewell...
Seika Ijichi, You really need to cut back. You never used to drink before you started playing concerts. It can't be good for you.
Kikuri Hiroi," C'mon, that's no biggie! Now, let's all go to Shinjuku! I can't hear you!"
Ikuyo Kita, Do you think she can really play like that?
Kikuri Hiroi," You're supposed to say ""go!"""
Kikuri Hiroi, Getting to see SICK HACK for free... My soul is on fire!
Ikuyo Kita, SICK HACK? Is that the name of Hiroi-san's band?
Kikuri Hiroi, Yep!
Hitori Gotou, I knew she was good from our street concert... But I don't really know what she sounds like. I'm kind of looking forward to this!
Hitori Gotou, I v-very much enjoyed the concert... Thank you for having me...
Nijika Ijichi, We're not even at the venue yet!
Kikuri Hiroi," Here's my home base, Shinjuku FOLT!"
Kikuri Hiroi," C'mon in, y'all!"
Ikuyo Kita, The vibe is very different from Starry's...
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, no worries. It's the same kind of place."
Hitori Gotou," It is a little scary, but I feel strangely confident. Clubs are the same wherever you—"
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thank you for the wonderful concert!
Nijika Ijichi," Seriously, it hasn't started yet!"
Hitori Gotou, I w-was a fool to think I'd grown as a person...
Nijika Ijichi, I'm sure they're nice people if you talk to them!
Kikuri Hiroi, Gin-chan! Mornin'!
Ginjiro Yoshida, Yeah?
Nijika Ijichi, I m-miss my sister!
Ikuyo Kita, It's gotten to Ijichi-senpai too!
Kikuri Hiroi," This is the manager, Gin-chan!"
Nijika Ijichi, H-Hello!
Ginjiro Yoshida," Oh, gosh, look at all the cute little buddies you brought! I'm Ginjiro Yoshida, 37 years old! Punk rock's my genre of choice!"
Kikuri Hiroi," The contrast between how he looks and talks kinda shorts out your brain, right? But don't worry. Gin-chan's a nice old guy with the heart of a pure maiden!"
Shima Iwashita," Hey, Hiroi."
Kikuri Hiroi, Yeah?
Shima Iwashita," For the millionth time, don't be late."
Eliza Shimizu, Our rehearsal's already over!
Kikuri Hiroi," Sorry! But it'll all work out, I bet!"
Shima Iwashita, Are these the members of Kessoku Band?
Nijika Ijichi, Y-Yes! And you're...
Ryo Yamada, She's part of SICK HACK.
Shima Iwashita," I'm Shima, the drummer. A pleasure."
Nijika Ijichi, It's such a pleasure to meet you!
Shima Iwashita, I'm sure our Hiroi's caused a lot of trouble for you. If this will in any way make up for it...
Hitori Gotou, Sh-She's so polite!
Nijika Ijichi," Oh, th-thank you!"
Hitori Gotou, Maybe the other band members balance her out?
Eliza Shimizu, I'm Eliza! I lived in England until I was eighteen. This is my third year in Japan. Let's be friends!
Nijika Ijichi, You came all the way to Japan to be in a band? Do you like J-Rock?
Eliza Shimizu," No. Actually, I came to Japan for Comiket! I really wanna be in an anisong cover band!"
Kikuri Hiroi, Eliza's always saying anisongs are Japan's real bleeding-edge sound!
Hitori Gotou, The three of them are... Balanced?
Eliza Shimizu, I bought this in Asakusa!
Kikuri Hiroi, Nice one!
Shima Iwashita, Stop now.
Bartender, Here you are.
Ikuyo Kita, Thank you! Look at all the people!
Nijika Ijichi, There's at least two hundred here.
Hitori Gotou, I had no idea her band was this popular...
Nijika Ijichi," By the way, where's Ryo?"
Ikuyo Kita, She was with us just minutes ago... Eh? She's sitting over there!
Nijika Ijichi," Sh-She's doing... the club classic: the ""I'm not like you overexcited sheeple"" customer!"
Ryo Yamada, Take in the sound. The sound!
Ikuyo Kita," Ryo-senpai. What kind of band is SICK HACK, exactly?"
Ryo Yamada, They play psychedelic rock. A genre that spread in the 1960s as a musical expression of drug-induced hallucinations whose influence led to many progressive rock bands getting their start...
Ikuyo Kita, I've never seen Senpai talk so much about anything.
Hitori Gotou, I c-can't wait to hear them.
Ikuyo Kita, Yeah! I'm kinda interested in psychedelic rock!
Ryo Yamada, Really? I'll bring all my albums tomorrow. It's best for a beginner to start from the second.
Nijika Ijichi," Better watch what you say, Kita-chan. That kind of line will get you mobbed by fanatics."
Hitori Gotou," Their band's amazing. The drum's spot-on irregular time signature that keeps you off-balance. The emotional yet overwhelmingly logical playing of the guitar... And the bass forms a wall of sound that supports it all. But the most amazing thing of all... is her overwhelming charisma! For the time they're standing on stage, performers are heroes! A band really is the coolest thing ever!"
Kikuri Hiroi, Bocchi-chan! How'd you like my show?
Hitori Gotou, I-It was great.
Kikuri Hiroi," Hey, what's got you so down? We stunk the place up after all?"
Hitori Gotou, N-Not at all. You really were incredible. But I... er... You were really shining up there. I don't think I could... ever...
Kikuri Hiroi," Lemme fill you in here. Up to high school, I was the gloomy misfit sittin' in a corner of the classroom. Could ya tell? I guess it's true what they say: gloomy people attract. But sometimes I'd imagine what my future was gonna look like, and I'd think, ""C'mon, that's lame!"" I started playing rock to make my life's course do a 180. At first, I was scared stiff of buying a bass at the music shop or going into a club. The whole reason I started drinking was to chill myself out before our first concert. Everyone's scared when they do something for the first time. But you played just fine, both on the street and at Starry! And you didn't even need alcohol to do it!"
Hitori Gotou, You mean...
Kikuri Hiroi," Have a little faith in yourself! And if that's not enough, have a drink to take the edge off!"
Hitori Gotou, I-I'm really too young. But I'd like you to come to our culture festival performance.
Kikuri Hiroi," Yeah, that's the way!"
Ginjiro Yoshida," I'm adding 100,000 to your tab for wall repairs."
Kikuri Hiroi, Th-That one's partly Bocchi-chan's fault!
Nijika Ijichi," Okay! Now that the concert's got us all hyped up, let's plot our culture festival setlist! Kita-chan said each band gets fifteen minutes. So that's about three songs, right?"
Ikuyo Kita, H-Hey... C-Can't I let Ryo-senpai have some of mine?
Nijika Ijichi, No! She needs to learn her lesson for bumming off of Bocchi-chan for so long.
Ryo Yamada, Ikuyo...
Nijika Ijichi," Kita-chan! Don't fall for our wicked bandmate's tricks! The three Bs to avoid in a boyfriend are bassist, bassist, and bassist, after all!"
Ryo Yamada, I'll never borrow money from anyone again.
Nijika Ijichi, Then I gift you this.
Ryo Yamada," You're kind, Nijika. I love you."
Nijika Ijichi," The legit gratitude is tugging on my heartstrings, darn it! Just help yourself already!"
Ryo Yamada, I already know our setlist. I've been thinking it over since the culture festival came up.
Nijika Ijichi, Nice!
Ryo Yamada," We'll put a Bocchi guitar solo in the second one. To make sure you shine. It's your and Ikuyo's culture festival, remember?"
Ikuyo Kita, But isn't going all-original in the culture festival a bit aggressive?
Nijika Ijichi, So what? Let's be aggressive!
Ryo Yamada," And if we bomb, there's four of us. We can split the shame four ways."
Nijika Ijichi," Ryo, are you trying to push your trauma on the rest of us?"
Hitori Gotou, Guitar solo...
Hitori Gotou, K-Kita-san?
Ikuyo Kita," G-Gotoh-san... I... I knew you'd thrown out the culture festival application! But I submitted it anyway. I'm so, so sorry that I lied!"
Hitori Gotou," Th-Thank you for doing it. I w-was pretty freaked out at first, but now I'm kind of looking forward to it. Th-That wouldn't have happened if you hadn't turned in the application. So I'm really grateful. Thank you."
Ikuyo Kita," Gotoh-san, I'm going to work even harder at practice than ever! So let's make our culture festival concert a success!"
Hitori Gotou, O-Okay.
Ikuyo Kita," The truth is, I really wanted Gotoh-san to perform at the culture festival. Because Gotoh-san is..."
Ikuyo Kita, Ryo-senpai! Would you be willing to coach me on guitar after work?
Ryo Yamada, Isn't Bocchi coaching you?
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san has her own practice to focus on. I want to practice and get better too!
Nijika Ijichi," You heard her. Humor her, okay?"
Ryo Yamada, My lessons don't come cheap.
Ikuyo Kita, Okay!
Nijika Ijichi, How come Bocchi-chan's not with you today?
Ikuyo Kita, Well... she's got make-up lessons...
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan's missing?!
Crowd, Anyone want a hot dog? Churros!! Class 2-2's doing a haunted house!
Nijika Ijichi," Boy, even the first day is a total event! Not at all like our school!"
Students," Hey, where do you wanna start? Dunno... I'd love to try Class 2's haunted house! Awesome! Let's do it!"
Ryo Yamada, It's like an entire school of Ikuyos.
Nijika Ijichi," Well, anyway... I think Bocchi-chan's class is nearby, so let's check that out!"
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, bet this's it! Hi-ho! Is Bocchi-chan in?"
Ryo Yamada," Serve us, Bocchi."
Ikuyo Kita, Senpai...
Nijika Ijichi, Kita-chan! Did you come to see Bocchi-chan in her maid costume too?
Ryo Yamada, Where's the Bocchi-chan maid?
Ikuyo Kita, About that...
Nijika Ijichi, What?! Bocchi-chan vanished?!
Students, She put on her maid costume and said she was going to the bathroom. We haven't seen her since. I wish she could've just told us if she didn't want to do it.
Nijika Ijichi, You'd think running around the school as a maid would be even more embarrassing... But whatever. Let's get searching!
Ikuyo Kita, Right!
Nijika Ijichi," No whining, you!"
Nijika Ijichi, No Bocchi-chan here... Where could she have gone? Maybe we should check all the women's bathrooms?
Ryo Yamada, All of them?
Ikuyo Kita, No... Gotoh-san won't be found in such a constantly inhabited location!
Nijika Ijichi," Aha! Where should we look, then? Teach us, Professor Kita!"
Ikuyo Kita," Allow me to elucidate! It must be uninhabited! It must be damp and depressing. We must search the kinds of ecosystems in which one might find slugs. She might be found beneath a rock, perchance!"
Ryo Yamada, Effortlessly brutal.
Hitori Gotou," I lied and ran off without thinking about it. I'm gonna make trouble for everyone if I don't get back. But I'll die from embarrassment if my band sees me like this. If only I had my ripe mangos... Welcome home! I long for the warmth of that cardboard box... It's no use. I'm gonna drive myself crazy like this. I need escapism. Let's retreat to the online world. I've been so busy with rehearsals, I haven't looked in ages... My comments section is the nicest place in the world. Every single comment is kind and— C-C-Crud! I-If I don't upload a video, my home... I'll lose my online home!"
Hitori Gotou," H-Huh? When was the last time I uploaded again? I've been so busy, I haven't even had time to think about it... I'll put something up the minute the culture festival's over!"
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, there she is!"
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan, your whole class is worried about you!"
Ryo Yamada, In a place you'd find slugs... You called it.
Ikuyo Kita, I feel justified in rummaging through those trash cans and cisterns!
Nijika Ijichi," Though it sorta stopped feeling like we were looking for a person... Anyway, come on back, would you?"
Hitori Gotou, Kay...
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, look! Right here! Kessoku Band It's got our name on it! But of course it does, right?"
Ikuyo Kita," Seeing Kessoku Band's name in our school does feel odd, doesn't it?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yeah.
Ryo Yamada, Don't get too worked up now. You'll just exhaust yourself.
Ikuyo Kita," R-Right! Let's take the day to just enjoy the culture festival! Right, Gotoh-san?"
Hitori Gotou," Unlike Kita-chan, I've never actually enjoyed a school event..."
Crowd, Line for the Class 2-2 haunted house ends here! One person incoming!
Nijika Ijichi, I've been really curious about this! You think we can take a little detour?
Ikuyo Kita, I'd like to try it too! It's getting great reviews!
Nijika Ijichi, Can we take another detour?
Students, One chocolate crêpe!
Nijika Ijichi, Chocolate banana? Or should I go with something more tart?
Ryo Yamada," Buy both, and give me some."
Ikuyo Kita, You bet!
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, no casual extortion."
Nijika Ijichi, Is that Bocchi-chan?! Here we go... Gotcha!
Students, Congratulations!
Nijika Ijichi, Yeah!
Ikuyo Kita," Nice work, Senpai!"
Hitori Gotou, Eh? It's almost like... Doing the culture festival as a group is actually pretty fun.
Nijika Ijichi, Easy-peasy!
Ryo Yamada, Thanks for winning that for me.
Nijika Ijichi, It's not for you.
Hitori Gotou, And...
Hitori Gotou, Wh-Where to next?
Nijika Ijichi, Good enthusiasm! Let's keep going until we do the full circuit!
Ikuyo Kita," I think you're having too much fun! And Gotoh-san has this... The longer we mess around out here, the later I get back to the maid cafe!"" ...look on her face!"
Hitori Gotou, B-Busted!
Students, Welcome to Class 1-2's maid cafe! Welcome home! Sit right here!
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san's class really went all-out!
Nijika Ijichi, They all look so cute!
Ikuyo Kita, And Gotoh-san's doing a great job standing up straight and looking customers in the eye!
Nijika Ijichi," I guess working for us really helped her out, huh?"
Ryo Yamada, No! She's just passed out on her feet.
Nijika Ijichi, You're right!
Ryo Yamada, Not good. A gang of post-apocalyptic hooligans...
Nijika Ijichi, Who let them into the school?!
Apocalypse Hooligan," Hey, babe. How's about you drop the sign and have a little fun with us?! My charge didn't even faze her! She's even got the confidence to make faces at us! She's somethin' else! Forgive us for our arrogance!"
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san's amazing! She's being so helpful!
Nijika Ijichi, Y-Yeah... I guess.
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan, we're ready to order!"
Hitori Gotou, Wh-Wh-What can I get you?!
Nijika Ijichi, Let's see... Hey... Anyone else notice how good Bocchi-chan looks in that maid outfit?
Ikuyo Kita," You look so good in frilly stuff, Gotoh-san!"
Nijika Ijichi," Yeah, totes! I wish you wouldn't wear that tracksuit all the time."
Hitori Gotou," W-Well, I... Wh-What is it?"
Ryo Yamada, Some bands do push the visual aspect... I never knew you were such an uncut gem!
Hitori Gotou, R-Ryo-san?
Ryo Yamada," We'll have you in a swimsuit in the video. For modern bands, it's views that do the talking! And bringing in those views requires a few sacrifices here and there!"
Hitori Gotou," No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Ryo Yamada, We'll wrap you in black tape and have you play on the ocean!
Nijika Ijichi, Stop using Bocchi-chan as a cash cow!
Hitori Gotou, P-Please just order!
Nijika Ijichi," Oh, right..."
Ryo Yamada, Can someone spot me?
Ikuyo Kita," Wow, it looks delicious!"
Nijika Ijichi, How about this? What's the Sure-Pure Melt-in-Your-Mouth Magic Omurice?
Hitori Gotou, It's just normal omurice.
Ikuyo Kita, And the Unicorn Fantasy Dream Sparkle-Shine Omurice?
Hitori Gotou, That's also normal omurice.
Ryo Yamada, And the Lie-4-U Die-4-U Sickly-Chic Omurice?
Hitori Gotou, It's... normal omurice.
Nijika Ijichi, So it's all the same thing with different names?!
Hitori Gotou, We spent all our budget on the costumes.
Hitori Gotou, O-One Sure-Pure M-Melt-in-Your-Mouth Magic Omurice...
Nijika Ijichi," Excuse me! I'd like one of these deliciousness spells, if you please!"
Hitori Gotou," Oh, w-well..."
Ryo Yamada," The customer's always right. Smirk, smirk. Smirk, smirk."
Nijika Ijichi," Help us out, Miss Maid!"
Ryo Yamada," Smirk, smirk. Smirk, smirk."
Ikuyo Kita, You guys are really enjoying this...
Hitori Gotou, Sure-sure pure-pure miracle squee omurice... Become delicious.
Ryo Yamada, Kind of grainy.
Hitori Gotou," Yeah, we bought them frozen..."
Ikuyo Kita," Gotoh-san! You need to put more love into the spell! Watch me work! Just like this! Sure-sure! Pure-pure! Miracle... Squee! If you please, omurice... Become delicious!"
Ikuyo Kita, Kit-aura
Nijika Ijichi," The acidity of the ketchup and sweetness of the sauce blend together, giving it the soul-warming feel of home cooking!"
Ryo Yamada, Smooth!
Students, Kita-chan! Would you mind helping our class out?
Ikuyo Kita, Could I?! I'd love to wear the costume!
Ikuyo Kita, How do I look?
Students," Kita-chan, you look so good!"
Nijika Ijichi, You're wearing the heck out of that thing!
Ikuyo Kita," Would you guys like to wear one, too? For the memory!"
Nijika Ijichi, What? Can we?
Students, Of course you can! Crazy cute! Crazy cute!
Ikuyo Kita," Hold it! Let's have Senpai in ""big sister"" style! Or... What about boy style?! A fabulous choice, if I do say so myself!"
Nijika Ijichi, Isn't she getting a bit too excited compared to with me?
Students, But the three of you together make such a powerful visual! Would you be willing to help us out a while?
Nijika Ijichi," No prob! I already work in customer service, so I got this handled!"
Students, Thank you! Thank you!
Nijika Ijichi, Welcome home!
Ikuyo Kita, Welcome home!
Nijika Ijichi, What bands are you here to see today?
Ikuyo Kita," Ijichi-senpai, this is a maid cafe!"
Nijika Ijichi," Ah, I slipped into my usual work persona!"
Hitori Gotou, Incredible. Kita-san and Nijika-chan have such overwhelming adaptability and customer service powers!
Apocalypse Hooligan, Scuse me! Could I have s'more water?
Ikuyo Kita," Ryo-senpai, you take care of them!"
Ryo Yamada, Heh. You want it? Come get it.
Apocalypse Hooligan, F-F-Forgive us for our arrogance!
Ikuyo Kita," This isn't the club! Still hot, though!"
Hitori Gotou," R-Ryo has her own inexplicable power, too..."
Apocalypse Hooligan, Thanks! Y-Y-Yeah!
Nijika Ijichi, Hey! I brought a group!
Students, Uh-oh!
Ikuyo Kita, Welcome home! Come right this way!
Culture Festival Planner," Gotoh-san, you can take a break!"
Hitori Gotou, S-Sure...
Hitori Gotou, This difference in reception... It feels like a preview of tomorrow's concert!
Students, Awesome! We're sold out of omurice already!
Culture Festival Planner, I bet we take first place in the class sales rankings!
Students, We owe it to Kita-chan and the rest of your band! Thank you so much!
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, it's no biggie! We had fun too! Thanks!"
Culture Festival Planner, We'll totally come to watch your concert tomorrow!
Nijika Ijichi, Awesome! Please do!
Ryo Yamada, And what about our fee? Don't tell me you expected us to work for free...
Nijika Ijichi, C'mon! We gotta go practice!
Ryo Yamada, Waaaagh...
Ikuyo Kita," But first, could we do one thing?"
Ikuyo Kita, I wanted to get a look at our venue before we left!
Nijika Ijichi," Wow, what a pretty gym!"
Ryo Yamada, The max occupancy must be around a thousand.
Ikuyo Kita," I doubt we'll get that many people, of course... But I sure hope we get a lot!"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yeah...
Nijika Ijichi, You bet we will! We've got Kita-chan power on our side!
Hitori Gotou, R-Right...
Hitori Gotou, I'll be standing up there tomorrow... Together with Kessoku Band!
Nijika Ijichi," I've been thinking, Bocchi-chan... Your guitar's pretty old, isn't it?"
Ryo Yamada," I noticed that too! The frets are rusty, plus the hairline cracks... It's a well-used vintage item, right? It could sell for quite a lot—"
Nijika Ijichi, Stop putting a price on everything.
Hitori Gotou," Um, I'm borrowing the one my dad used when he was younger... So I guess it is pretty old."
Nijika Ijichi," He's coming with your family tomorrow, right?"
Hitori Gotou," Y-Yeah... He couldn't make it to our concert because of the storm, but he was pretty excited. He even bought a camcorder!"
Naoki Gotou, Vibes in the house!
Nijika Ijichi, I can totally imagine it!
Ikuyo Kita, My friends sent me a LOINE message about how much they're looking forward to it!
Nijika Ijichi, All the more reason to give it our best!
Hitori Gotou," Y-Yeah, guess so!"
Nijika Ijichi," Oh, right... What kind of MCing should I do for tomorrow's concert?"
Ikuyo Kita," Introduce us, the songs, and add a little commentary, I guess?"
Hitori Gotou, Th-That sounds good to me.
Nijika Ijichi," Well, what we do now is fine... But I thought a little funny MCing like popular bands do might be fun."
Ryo Yamada, Band MCing is never funny. Fans just laugh along to humor them. Opinions expressed are solely Yamada's
Nijika Ijichi, Way too harsh!
Ryo Yamada," Once we get popular, even your lousiest MCing will pick up big laughs. Don't worry."
Nijika Ijichi, Is that a reassurance or a diss?!
Hitori Gotou, Break-up imminent!
Ikuyo Kita," Now, now! No fighting! Let's finish our practice!"
Nijika Ijichi," Right, sorry. Let's do it! Okay, here we go!"
Nijika Ijichi, Sounds great!
Hitori Gotou, Huh?
Ryo Yamada, Yeah.
Ikuyo Kita, That was wonderful!
Hitori Gotou, Kita-san's kind of...
Ikuyo Kita," What's the matter, Gotoh-san?"
Hitori Gotou," Oh, I thought... I just really hope people enjoy our concert!"
Ikuyo Kita," Yeah, I know they will!"
Ryo Yamada, That's good. Be confident.
Nijika Ijichi," We're counting on you, Bocchi-chan!"
Ikuyo Kita, We all need to have self-confidence. I think you'll knock everyone's socks off!
Hitori Gotou," Oh, I doubt that..."
Ikuyo Kita, You totally will! Because you're so amazingly... No... Never mind. Let's just do our best!
Hitori Gotou, R-Right!
Nijika Ijichi," Well, that's all for today! In preparation for tomorrow, let's all get to bed early! Right!"
Hitori Gotou," Good work today, all!"
Ikuyo Kita," It's got that autumn feeling, huh?"
Nijika Ijichi, I figured we'd be working on our first mini-album by now.
Ikuyo Kita, We're making steady progress. That's all that matters!
Hitori Gotou, It's almost here. The festival performance. My first performance in front of the school. I can't be as confident as Kita-san is. But I do hope they enjoy us!
Nijika Ijichi, My sister said she'd be here too!
Ikuyo Kita," Wow, really?"
Hitori Gotou," Okay, girl. Have faith in yourself! Trust that it's all going to go right. What if... What if a record company producer is in the audience?"
Guitar man, Magnifique! You deserve a debut contract!
Hitori Gotou," The success story of a high school band... Maybe it'll make the news, and we'll become a legend!"
Ikuyo Kita," Back in her own little world, huh?"
Nijika Ijichi," Time to go, Bocchi-chan!"
Hitori Gotou, C-Coming!
Nijika Ijichi," They're loving the band before us, huh?"
Ikuyo Kita, They're playing a big hit song from this year.
Ryo Yamada, Who waves glowsticks at a rock concert?
Ikuyo Kita, I'm so nervous now!
Nijika Ijichi, Kita-chan! Deep breaths! Bocchi-chan! You okay?
Hitori Gotou, Yes!
Nijika Ijichi," Six months ago she had to wear the mango box, and now she's facing it head-on!"
Ryo Yamada, Why's this band's drummer so loud?
Ikuyo Kita," Gotoh-san, you breathe too! Deep breath in... Deep breath out. Deep breath in... Deep breath out."
Culture Festival Announcer, Kessoku Band! You're up soon!
Nijika Ijichi," Right! Okay! Wanna do a huddle? Oh! Or that thing where we put our hands together and go ""Yeah!"""
Ikuyo Kita, I love it! Let's do it!
Ryo Yamada, So stuffy.
Nijika Ijichi," Left hands, all!"
Ikuyo Kita, Okay!
Nijika Ijichi, Just do it already!
Ikuyo Kita," You too, Gotoh-san!"
Hitori Gotou, R-Right.
Nijika Ijichi," Now, let's play hard and have fun! One, two..."
Culture Festival Announcer, Our next band is Kessoku Band!
s Friends, Kita-chan! Kita-chan! Kita-chan!
Ikuyo Kita, Hi!
Hitori Gotou, It's just what I expected.
Futari Gotou, Big Sis! Give it your best!
s Fans, Hitori-chan!
Hitori Gotou, M-My fans!
s Fans, Give it your best!
Hitori Gotou," People from my class, too... It's not just what I expected!"
Kikuri Hiroi," Hey! Kick ass up there, Bocchi-chan! Hey, look! 'Cuz today's special, I'm drinkin' the kind that comes in glasses! Gimme a good show, 'kay?!"
Students, Reeks of booze! I'm not sure she should be here...
Kikuri Hiroi," Huh? Whu? Don't ignore me, Bocchi-chan! It's me, Big Sister Kikuri!"
Hitori Gotou, I shouldn't have invited her!
Seika Ijichi," Get it together, loser!"
Kikuri Hiroi," S-Senpai... Uncle, uncle!"
Ikuyo Kita," We're Kessoku Band, and we mainly play outside of school. We hope our performance helps make today more memorable for everyone. And if you're interested, we hope you'll come to see us at our club! Here comes our first song... as Kessoku Band!"
Ikuyo Kita," Thank you! That was our first song, I Will Never Forget!"
Hitori Gotou, I can't believe how enthusiastic they are. But...
s Friends, Kita-chan! You were so cute!
Ikuyo Kita," Now, before we play our next song... Let's have a few words from Kessoku Band's leader: our drummer and my senpai, Nijika Ijichi!"
Seika Ijichi, They've worked pretty hard.
Kikuri Hiroi, Yeah... But Bocchi-chan...
Nijika Ijichi," Our esteemed bassist, Ryo Yamada, told me that any MCing I did for Kessoku Band would be a flop, and at first I thought, ""How dare you!"" But until I learn to be entertaining with this stuff, I figured I'd stick to concert announcements! Of course, I don't actually know when our next concert'll be... But if you wanna see more, just hit up our vocalist, Kita-chan,"
s Friends, Kita-chan!
Crowd, Hitori-chan!
Nijika Ijichi," Nice to meet you, everyone! Are you having a good time?! or our guitarist, Bo— Hitori Gotoh, when you can! Anyway, let's move on to the next song!"
Ikuyo Kita, Right! Please lend us your ears! Our next song is To Become a Constellation...!
Hitori Gotou," Yeah, something's not right. It's been fine this whole time, but now I can't get the E string in tune... The E string! Not good... But if I can at least get the B string in tune... The peg's broken!"
Kikuri Hiroi, She can't use the B string now. She won't be able to do her solo.
Hitori Gotou," What'll I do? My solo's coming up... If our big culture festival performance fails because I had equipment trouble... What do I do? What do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do?! Kita-san... She's ad-libbing completely on the fly!"
Ikuyo Kita, I'm going to make sure everyone can see... how amazingly cool Gotoh-san really is!
Crowd," What's their guitarist doing? Dunno, but it's pretty awesome!"
Seika Ijichi, Who whips out the bottleneck playing at a time like this?
Kikuri Hiroi, Now it won't matter if she's a little out of tune!
Ikuyo Kita," Well... I wasn't going to say anything before our last song, but please let me say one thing! Thanks so much for having us today! We're gonna try our best to become so good, that one day you'll brag about having seen us here!"
Crowd," Awesome! Budokan-bound! You were great, Whatever-san! You did good even when your string broke!"
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, Gotoh-san! Looks like you've gotta say something!"
Hitori Gotou, P-People with social anxiety can't talk without a pre-arranged script! If you put me in this unplanned situation... Say something funny. Something funny. Something... Something... funny...
Ikuyo Kita, Gotoh-san? Gotoh-san?!
Nijika Ijichi," You okay, Bocchi-chan?!"
Crowd, Someone call a teacher!
Ryo Yamada, You're a legendary rock star!
Kikuri Hiroi, Bocchi-chan rocks!
Seika Ijichi, At least show a little concern!
Nijika Ijichi, Seriously!
Crowd, Someone bring a stretcher!
Naoki Gotou, Hitori! You okay?!
Futari Gotou, I'm sorry about my sister.
Nijika Ijichi," H-Hey, it's fine!"
Hitori Gotou, It's all over.
Ikuyo Kita," Are you all right, Gotoh-san? Are you conscious?"
Hitori Gotou, Y-Yeah...
Ikuyo Kita, Thank goodness. Looks like it wasn't too bad.
Hitori Gotou, Um... I'm really sorry I ruined everything. After all you did...
Ikuyo Kita," Actually, I think people liked it even more."
Hitori Gotou, Um... Where are the others?
Ikuyo Kita," They're cleaning up now. They said we'd have an after-party if you were feeling well enough. But if you aren't, we can save it for later."
Hitori Gotou," R-Right... Oh, that was a surprise. Kita-san. You got so good so fast."
Ikuyo Kita," Only for rhythm, of course."
Hitori Gotou, Um...
Ikuyo Kita," I can't do the kind of playing that really draws people in. But I seem to be pretty good at the give-and-take with you guys. I'm gonna keep working on my playing, so please keep teaching me. Gotoh-sa— Hitori-chan."
Hitori Gotou, R-Right!
Ikuyo Kita," Okay, I'm off! Come by when you're ready!"
Hitori Gotou, R-Right...
Ikuyo Kita, I'm going to become good enough to support Hitori-chan.
Speaker Voice, Culture Festival will now come to an end.
Kikuri Hiroi, After-party! After-party!
Nijika Ijichi, I hope Bocchi-chan's okay...
Students," Hey, it's the stage diver. Oh, the crazy rocker chick?"
Hitori Gotou," Some day... Some day, I will quit high school!"
Hitori Gotou," Forgive me, Father!"
Futari Gotou," What're you doing, Sis?"
Hitori Gotou, I broke the guitar Dad lent me while we were playing!
Naoki Gotou," P-Please, get up! I'm really not mad! Please? It's just a broken peg, right? It's really not that big a deal."
Hitori Gotou, But...
Naoki Gotou," Plus, it was pretty rad the way you broke it in the middle of the concert! Nowadays, they sell guitars designed to break. You should use one of those in your next gig!"
Hitori Gotou, What kind of daughter are you trying to raise?
Naoki Gotou," Anyway, this is probably a good opportunity for you to buy your own guitar."
Futari Gotou," Play with me, Dad! C'mon, Dad!"
Michiyo Gotou, What a good idea!
Naoki Gotou," That way, if you hit an issue like this again, you can deal with it right away."
Hitori Gotou," But... Even though I do have a job, all the money goes to my quotas. I can't afford..."
Naoki Gotou, No worries! You've got money!
Hitori Gotou," Wh-Where'd it all come from? Dad, are you involved in some shady dealings?!"
Hitori Gotou, I c-can't accept your dirty money!
Naoki Gotou, We're not that badly off!
Michiyo Gotou, That's money you earned from advertisements on your videos.
Naoki Gotou," See, if a video gets enough views, they pay you. Did you forget the video site account you use is a family account?"
Hitori Gotou," You mean, my videos..."
Naoki Gotou," We know all about 'em! guitarhero, right? They've been racking up the views, so I monetized 'em in secret. How'd my girl get so good?! I figured you'd need the money eventually. And it's been amazing to see you work so hard and get better and better at the guitar. Right, dear?"
Michiyo Gotou," Yes. I don't know much about music, but I do think you're amazing at it!"
Hitori Gotou, Dad... Mom...
Naoki Gotou," Of course, it's balanced out by my sadness at seeing you get better and better at lying..."
Hitori Gotou, Barf!
Hitori Gotou," There's 300,000 yen here. I never imagined getting such a windfall. If I buy a guitar that costs 100k, I'll have 200k left... And if I put that all to quota costs, I could play for almost two years without having to work a normal job! Yes! I'm totally quitting!"
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan's been unusually chipper today.
Ikuyo Kita, And she bows at me every time we make eye contact.
Hitori Gotou, The thought of quitting my job fills me with a mysterious and overwhelming power! Time to talk to the manager now!
Nijika Ijichi, Ultra super Bocchi-chan?
Seika Ijichi, What's this about your job?
Hitori Gotou, I... W-Well... S-See... I'll continue to work my hardest and most earnestly at it.
Seika Ijichi, What's with the sudden declaration of commitment?
Hitori Gotou," There's nothing harder than declaring you're gonna quit a job. Maybe I should ghost them... But they do know where I li— Uh, I mean, I don't want to put them out..."
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan! You're going to the music shop today, right?"
Hitori Gotou," Maybe if I buy an instrument for the manager, she'll let me quit! I've got lots of money now, after all!"
Nijika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan?
Hitori Gotou, H-Hey... Could you ask the manager if there's anything she wants?
Nijika Ijichi," Bocchi-chan asked that. Since your birthday's coming up, maybe she's talking about a present?"
Seika Ijichi, I don't want anything.
Nijika Ijichi, She says no thanks!
Hitori Gotou, I'm finished.
Ryo Yamada, Bocchi. I'd like a Dingwall and new Le Fay headless and a Darkglass amp head.
Ikuyo Kita," We're heading to the music shop, everyone!"
Nijika Ijichi, Let's la go!
Seika Ijichi, Bocchi-chan's really nice.
san, Have fun!
Seika Ijichi, But I prefer my presents to be a surprise.
Nijika Ijichi," If you wanna buy an instrument, you gotta go to Ochanomizu!"
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, Hitori-chan! Do you know why there are so many music shops here?"
Ryo Yamada," Well, you see... The music business flourished here due to it playing host in the Meiji Period to Japan's oldest professional orchestra, leading to the formation of now-legacy stores in Ochanomizu like Shimokura Music, Ishibashi Music, and etc etc, blah blah, yada yada..."
Nijika Ijichi, I bet we'll be seeing a lot of this today.
Nijika Ijichi, Let's go in here! It's got a great selection!
Hitori Gotou," I'd really rather not. I was gonna just buy one online, but..."
Nijika Ijichi," Ordering online is fine and all, but you really oughta handle a guitar before you buy it!"
Hitori Gotou, R-Right...
Hitori Gotou," Music store owners are scary, and if one were to start talking to me..."
Imaginary Music Store Owner," You like that guitar? You got good taste, dearie. You like Western music? Wait, you don't?! Time to die!"
Hitori Gotou," If I put on headphones like I'm listening to music, maybe no one will talk to me!"
Music Store Clerk, M-Manager! A major headbanger has entered the store!
Music Store Manager, Must be a hardcore metal fan!
Music Store Clerk, Ma'am! The heavy metal guitars are on the second floor!
Ikuyo Kita, What a cute strap!
Nijika Ijichi," This color would look great with your guitar, Kita-chan!"
Ikuyo Kita, Look at all the kinds of picks! Maybe I'll turn some into earrings!
Nijika Ijichi, What a great idea!
Music Store Clerk," What's the matter, ma'am? Ma'am?"
Ikuyo Kita," Can we stop by a hobby shop after this? Plus, I checked in advance and found out there's a nice café nearby!"
Music Store Clerk, Ma'am?!
Ryo Yamada, Look at the damn instruments.
Ryo Yamada, Excuse me. Can I try out this bass?
Music Store Clerk, Go ahead.
Ikuyo Kita," You're buying another, Senpai?"
Ryo Yamada," No. I just like how it looks, so I'd like to play it a bit. Ah, is slapping okay?"
Music Store Clerk," Yes, that's fine."
Ryo Yamada, Like this.
Nijika Ijichi, Is she going to do that?
Ryo Yamada, Amazing. I didn't even go that hard. What a great bass!
Nijika Ijichi, When you go all-out but act smug about it!
Hitori Gotou, Not that I mind.
Ryo Yamada," What is it, Ikuyo? You like that guitar?"
Ikuyo Kita," No, it's not like that... I've still got the guitar you lent me, after all!"
Ryo Yamada, You can never have too many guitars.
Nijika Ijichi," They're all having so much fun. Is this the lonely drummer thing I see in manga all the time? M-Maybe I'll buy a guitar and a bass myself! Just to play, darn it!"
Ryo Yamada, I see. Were you feeling lonely?
Nijika Ijichi, Let's hit up a drum shop next time! There's one in Akiba.
Hitori Gotou, This one's cool...
Music Store Manager," Yamaha's pretty great, huh? That one's custom-made, too. It's a really great guitar, especially for the price! Would you like to try it out?"
Hitori Gotou, Um... Um...
Music Store Manager," If it's your first guitar, you might want shielding and a mini amp!"
Hitori Gotou, I... I'll take the lot.
Nijika Ijichi," You already have that stuff, Bocchi-chan!"
Music Store Manager," Oh, you already play? I'm so sorry!"
Ikuyo Kita," Hey, that's okay. Her guitar broke recently, so she's looking for a replacement. Right, Hitori-chan?"
Music Store Manager, Lots of people have multiples nowadays. Even students!
Ikuyo Kita," Oh, really? You like this guitar, Hitori-chan? Right. Right. She'll take this guitar, please! Right, Hitori-chan?"
Music Store Manager, Thank you so much!
Ryo Yamada, Bocchi's like a ventriloquist dummy.
Nijika Ijichi," I thought she'd matured a lot lately, But I guess she still has some ways to go."
Music Store Manager," I'm so glad. I've been doing checks and maintenance on this guitar myself. It's really well made. I like it a lot. I'm sure the guitar's happy that it's going with you, too. Thank you for coming!"
Hitori Gotou, Th-Thank you for having me!
Music Store Manager, M-Ma'am?! You forgot your guitar!
Nijika Ijichi, How desperate was she to get out of here?
Nijika Ijichi, Here! The manager wants you to come by again some time.
Hitori Gotou, R-Right. Sorry...
Ikuyo Kita, I'm really glad you found a good guitar!
Hitori Gotou, R-Right.
Nijika Ijichi, What now? Wanna grab food first?
Ryo Yamada, We're done.
Nijika Ijichi, Got something else to do?
Ryo Yamada," Bocchi. You want to play your guitar as soon as possible, right?"
Ikuyo Kita," Hey! Stop having a telepathic connection, you two!"
Nijika Ijichi," Hey, it's no big deal."
Ikuyo Kita, I know! Want to rent a studio and try out your new guitar?
Hitori Gotou," Ah, I'd rather not..."
Nijika Ijichi," We'll all get to practice together tomorrow, anyway. We'll save the fun for then!"
Hitori Gotou, R-Right.
Nijika Ijichi," The culture festival is behind us. We'd better start thinking about our next concert, right?"
Ikuyo Kita, That's right!
Nijika Ijichi," Write us lots of new songs, Ryo!"
Ryo Yamada, Just waiting for inspiration to strike.
Ikuyo Kita, Let me know if there's anything I can do!
Ryo Yamada, Anything?
Nijika Ijichi, Kita-chan! Don't say that to Ryo unless you're ready to follow through!
Ryo Yamada, You can start by treating me to gyudon.
Futari Gotou, Sis! Hurry up or you'll be late!
Hitori Gotou, A-Awesome... I'm s-sorry! I haven't f-forgotten you! Forgive me!
Michiyo Gotou, She's at it again.
Hitori Gotou, Be back later.
Hitori Gotou, Another day at the job.
